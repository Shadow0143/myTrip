This is in stark contrast to the unmasked ZWO filter flats that caused all this issue. With a filter that's spectrally narrower, however, the difficult part is maintaining a constant signal (% transmission at the emission line). At some point I will see what they look like without the filter masks. I mean really FLAT. Sign up for savings and product announcements. Stating that were the best can seem a bit like a catch. Whether they are worth 3X the price is up to you. The E-Series filters were designed for cameras containing the full-frame Kodak KAF8300, KAF3200, KAF6303, KAF16803 sensors. They recently came out with a 3.5 nm H- narrowband filter and those results are even worse, ranging from 3-70% at the emission wavelength. Astrodon NB filters are renowned for not producing halos around stars and not leaking NIR light. If you are willing to deal with oddities, you can spend less and make that choice. document.getElementById("copyright_year").innerHTML = new Date().getFullYear(); H- (hydrogen-alpha) at 656 nm (nanometers) is deep red in color and the most popular narrowband filter. Bright Light transmission through the 36mm Astrodon E-series RED filter, Bright Light transmission through the 36mm Astrodon E-series GREEN filter, Bright Light transmission through the 36mm Astrodon E-series BLUE filter, Bright Light transmission through the 36mm Astrodon 5nm OIII narrow band filter, Bright Light transmission through the 36mm Astrodon 5nm Ha narrow band filter, Bright Light transmission through the 36mm Astrodon 5nm SII narrow band filter. The other thread I referred to in the first post on this thread has all the details about reflection issues with the ZWO filters, how to suppress them and how to process the remain effect out of your images using pixinsight. I just hope I have enough time on target and my process skills are up to the challenge. This comparison should not be what you make a purchasing decision based on. Peak transmittance guaranteed >90% at the emission line (97-98%T typical) f/10 to f/3.5 for both 3 nm and 5 nm Premium grade H-alpha interline chip CCD-filter for fast optical systems f/10 to f/2.8IR-blockedNO halos, NO reflections, NO ghostingNon-aging sealed coating edgesBaader's new H-Alpha passfilter enables high-contrast deep sky images of H-II regions (such H-alpha filters are essential for imaging nebulae and other objects which are rich in ionized hydrogen. I hope to have it done tonight. Back Ordered - We're Working With The Supplier To Obtain Delivery ASAP - Will Ship First Order In - First Order Out - As It Becomes Available. Please note that due to Covid-19 and a high volume of orders, some products could be on backorder at our suppliers and may have longer delays for the delivery. Please re-enable javascript to access full functionality. I also had previously posted a thread asking what were the benefits of the Astrodon filters and were they worth the price premium. If you're looking for other sporting optics or weapons scopes, please visit our partner site. Tri-color narrowband imaging using these three filters is possible with the Moon up so your imaging gear doesn't have to be sidelined for weeks at a time. The narrow 5 and 3 nm bandwidths enhance contrast of emission targets by lowering your background signal. The did a simple stretch using the setting from the screen transfer function. Again, this saves you precious imaging time and thus, simplifies your imaging. Pour obtenir un service personnalis en franais, merci de communiquer avec nous par tlphone ou par courriel. Nous continuons de prendre vos commandes en ligne. I used pixinsight for all processing. I think the narrow band contrast is amazing with the Astrodon filters. We accept the following forms of payment:  Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, Direct Wire Transfer, Money Orders & Checks. They were processed identically in Pixinsight. Im thinking about putting together a new mono setup and spending a massive amount of cash on Astrodon filters will be my biggest dilemma when the time comes. There was a bit of asymmetry to the narrow band flats histogram, but it was very slight. >4 OD (out of band blocking) 300  1150 nm The intensity rings are very weak and are only visible with the extreme non-linear stretch. The Alnitak region is notorious for halo "spoiling" images of the horsehead and flame nebula from the O-class supergiant star Zeta-Orionus. Under the heading capacity you can find the technical properties of an accessory. This is the Ha filter. Dont get this very useful thread closed. >80%T for SII at f/3 The USB was set at 90 for both. I was afraid that the un-blackened edges of the LRGB filters may lead to reflections so I decided to use the filter masks that came for the ZWO filters to install the Astrodon filters. You still have to decide what your money is worth and whether to and on what to spend it. When buying at Astronomy Plus, in addition to having the best pre-sale and post-sale service, we offer you the best deals available. However, for now, there is no evidence of any likely issue due to the reflections from the Astrodon filters. This is as direct an apples-to-apples comparison as I could do between the ZWO and Astrodon filters and for me is a direct answer to what you get for your money with Astrodon. I was a bit disappointed by this, but If necessary, I can probably blacken them myself with a sharpie. I used the master flats that I showed above along with Dark frames for calibration. I would say that here is where the Astrodon filters shine. See the first quote, had nothing to do with you dude. It took a lot of time and effort, but this showed that the ZWO filters ARE usable with the proper masking and image processing. AstrodonNarrowbandfilters currently are provided off-the-shelf for: When we refer to bandwidth, we are referring to the spectral width of the transmission region at 50% of the peak transmittance (FWHM  full width at half maximum). Hydrogen-alpha H- 656.3 nm 5 and 3 nm, Red Continuum RedCon 645 nm 5 nm only, Oxygen OIII  500.7 nm 5 and 3 nm, Other emission lines, bandwidths and sizes upon request, Warehouse Prices (Amazon, Best Buy, etc. The Narrow band filters had backened edges. Actually, the >90%T is a legacy specification, since new production technologies employed over the past 3-4 years routinely produces 97-98%T at the emission wavelengths. All the histograms for the LRGB were very symmetric. We truly believe our team is a cut above the rest and we look forward working with you! If you want to spend coin on the best results, you buy Astrodon. I used SGP flats calibration wizard to set the exposure. If you had to make a compromise, I would say that the ZWO LRGB are not bad and that if you had to make a compromise the the ZWO LRGB and the Astrodon narrow band (especially the Ha and SII). This is the RED filter surface as received. The filters were quite clean except for the dust. 524/2013 on Alternative and Online Dispute Resolution (ADR / ODR), online retailers are obliged to place an , Astrodon 36mm Narrowband Filter H-Alpha 5nm unmounted. 30 arcsecond parallelism It has a huge amount of data in it and I highly suggest reading it in full if you are considering filter purchases or how to fix these types of issues. I would say that the Astrodon filters are clearly superior, but whether they are worth 3X the price is up to you. Be first to review this item and help others. Here are the comparisons. Manufacturer's warranty period, if known. 1.25 Round Mounted (HA3_27R) In hindsight, I may not have made that purchase at the end since I was able to show that I could get good images. After creating the master flats, I then used the STF to do a stretch of each masterflat and showed the histograms. That being said - I am going to keep the ZWO filters since I hope to get a second ASI1600MM-C for my other OTAs and retire my Canon T5i unmodified. The comparison images for the ZWO filters are here: Im following this thread. To me, they appear to be better from this point of view than my ZWO filters with the best masks that I could make. This is why our >90%T guarantee is so important, even though it becomes very costly to manufacture. The next filter to complement your LRGBH-a set is an oxygen filter. Astrodon Narrowband filters for imaging are all about contrast. Main image may not depict the exact filter you receive. At the 36mm size, the Astrodon filters are ~3X the cost of the ZWO filters. I think that this is a great example of how this community can work together to help us all out. W will be closed next week, from Monday August 1st to Wednesday August 3rd, for the annual inventory. Free Shipping to lower 48 states for all orders over $100, Astrodon I-Series LRGB Filter set unmounted 36 mm, Set includes Luminance (NIR/UV-blocked colorless), Red, Green and Blue filters, 3 +/-0.025 mm single 1/4 wave fused silica substrate before coating, ~1:1:1 color combine weights for G2V white-point for Kodak Interline detectors, Better color rendition for galaxies based upon color theory, Significant reflection and star halo reduction, Spectral "gap" between green and red filters to reduce the effects of light pollution, Highest efficiency blue filter with less UV, Correct "teal" OIII color for planetary nebula (OIII signal >97% in blue and green), Ultra-hard and durable sputtered coatings coated to the edge of each filter. Prior to mounting the filter wheel and camera back onto the OTA, I took transmission images through the filters to look at the reflections and how well the edge coating worked. These two factors combine to provide you with the highest contrast available. This is not akin to whether or not Denon or Sony make better audio equipment at all. Astrodon Narrowband filters for imaging are all about contrast. I do think they are worth the investment. Our recent blueshift data show that Astrodon 3 and 5 nm filters can be used with nearly all systems as fast as f/3.5 with virtually no loss in emission signal, so you do not need to buy custom upshifted filters if you have both fast and slow systems. At the end of the day, whether something is worth the price is clearly a subjective decision. I know his material is not marketing crap. For me I worked very hard to solve these issue and am just posting the results so that others might make a better choice than I did. Our team of product advisors know what its like to buy astronomy equipment for the first time. >90%T at the emission wavelengths for 5 nm OIII and H-a at f/3. What do we mean by this? This test is doing nothing that has not already been done in the past, ad nauseum. Once I process the mosiacs with both filter types I will add that to the thread. Please take this a just data to help others. Theres never any pressure to buy, and you can rest assured that your recommendation is personalized for you rather than motivated by financial gain. The OIII filter was less so, but still highly reflective. Similarly, analysis of different 2016 lots of Astrodon 3 nm H-a filters measured 97, 97, 97 and 96%T. For the best experience on our site, be sure to turn on Javascript in your browser. Without a non-linear stretch, there was no visible feature at all to any of the master flat frames. Im hoping this thread will help guide me. All the flats were - well FLAT.  AstrodonNarrowbandfilters set a new bar of performance and durability for imaging and research. Only logged in customers who have purchased this product may leave a review. La version franaise de Astronomie Plus est prsentement en cours de traduction. This was the test I chose since it is basically worst case. There halos on the ZWO filters is quite stark and there is basically none with the Astrodon filters. I have learned a lot in the process. They appeared to be some sort of coated paper with no inner cushioning material like the narrow band filters. OK so here is the imaging tests - the money post so to speak. This shop uses cookies that are necessary for its correct function and, if necessary, also uses cookies from third party providers. Just for point of reference, I went through exactly the same dilema with respect to the Astrodon filters and the price. At the end of the day I would say that the Astrodon filters are CLEARLY superior to the ZWO filters in many ways. I have since installed and ran the Astrodon filters and collected an identical set of data on the same target of Alnitak. In doing so, we try as best we can, the country of origin of our visitors from the IP of the requesting browser. The ZWO filter masks do overlap some at the edges so that they do not sit flat onto the filter wheel. There is a clear difference between what you get in terms of your data with Astrodon filters and other brands. Prices are subject to change without prior notice, 2022 Astronomy Plus  | Serving Astronomers since 1988, Free delivery in Canada for order over 500$! Yes, I did read everything posted on the Astrodon web site and several of his lectures from conferences on filters, bandwidths, effect of high focal ratio, even on using SII for high z galaxies to see Ha. >90%T for 3 nm OIII at f/3 Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk. I am not sure who you were responding to here. This effect is even more pronounced with narrower bandwidth filters. Astrodon >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Others. 31mm Round Mounted (HA3_31R) Astrodon Narrowband filters are renowned for minimizing halos around bright stars, even for long exposures of 30-45 minutes typical of narrowband imaging in astrophotography. For me, my time and getting nothing to show for a lot of imaging time led to enough frustration that I forked over the cash. Since I put the ZWO masks in place, this is not really fair, but that was what I have here: Bright Light transmission through the 36mm Astrodon E-series LUM filter. Your personal data will be used to support your experience throughout this website, to manage access to your account, and for other purposes described in our privacy policy. That thread also generated a lot of passion to say the least. Nous serons ferms la semaine prochaine, du lundi 1er aot au mercredi 3 aot, pour linventaire annuel. This is the 36mm Astrodon Ha filter fully installed and mounted in the ZWO EFW using the ZWO filter mask. Random tests of a competitors low-cost 7 nm H-a filter showed %T values ranging from 86% down to 71%. This is not meant to be a lot of processing - it was the exact same set of actions that I did on the ZWO filter set data. The problem is keeping the signal (%T at the emission line) constant as the filter becomes spectrally narrower. You can see the increase in contrast in the sequence of equal-exposure images of the Crescent Nebula (NGC 6888) taken on the same system and on the same night. Information about areas of application serves as a rough orientation. You are just not making the right data-driven decision, which I am trying to tell you to do. You totally missed my point. However, most imagers blend their H- data into their red RGB data to enhance structural detail while maintaining a natural look. You can go look on Astrobin, or the hundreds of threads here where people have make it 100% clear that Baader, Astronomik, ZWO, and Optolong filters are far inferior. What do we mean by this? The Astrodon 3nm H-alpha Filter is deep red in color and the most popular narrowband filter. If anyone here thought I was trying to be rude, I apologize in advance, but this discussion has been had in many permutations and the end result is always the same. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk, Mount: ORION HDX-110 EQ-G using EQMOD/CdC - Side-by-side, OTA:ORION EON 115mm APO with JMI motorized focuser/PCFC2, Camera: ZWO ASI1600MM-C with a Williams Optics Flattener IV - 660mm FL. For lack of a better term, the LRGB sleeves were a bit like wax paper - not that they were wax paper, but I think the sleeve for the narrow band filters are much better. For the best experience on our site, be sure to turn on Javascript in your browser. We offer 5 nm and ultra-narrow 3 nm bandwidths. If you are not, then my apologies. 36mm Round Unmounted (HA3_36R) For me I worked very hard to solve these issue and am just posting the results so that others might make a better choice than I did. You currently have javascript disabled. I previous posted the master frames for a short set of exposure for each filter for the ZWO set and duplicated the exact set of exposures with the exact same optics with the Astrodon filters installed as describe above. I was able to clean this residue off with some 5% IPA in DI water. Famous last words. Edited by cfosterstars, 16 January 2018 - 11:36 PM. I took 40 flat frames per filter and 50 dark flat frames to calibrate the flats.

Only after logging in, the country of origin is definitively known, and the VAT rate is always displayed correctly in every case. The surfaces of the LRGB filters were not clean like the Narrow band filters and appeared to have some sort of residue on the surface. Nous vous remercions de votre patience. (Certain exceptions). For many emission nebulae, H-Alpha, OIII, and SII filters all give you that Hubble look. There was only a small amount of dust on the filters that was easily blown off. A tradeoff can be made for other brands, and there is nothing wrong with that, but it is important to be 100% clear with people that read this now, and read this in the future -- you are making a tradeoff. And again thanks to everyone who has contributed to this set of post. I also have a Narrow band three-panel mosaic of M42 and the running man with the ZWO filters to process and I just finished a collecting a two panel mosaic in HaLRGB of the Horsehead and flame with the Astrodon with much more data collection to process. Like the H-Alpha filter, the SII filter also has a deep red color close to 672 nm. As I and others has posted, the ZWO filter have rather pronounced halos around brighter stars. At the end of the day, I was able to generate data that was basically clean enough to eliminate any filter-induced artifacts in my final images. I have learned a lot in the process.                             your order. As the bandwidth becomes narrower, the nebula pops out of the background, as does the faint surrounding nebulosity. Astrodon Narrowband filters set a new bar of performance and durability for imaging and research. Leaving you with confidence knowing you are making the right decision and one that is perfect for you and your goals of viewing the night sky! Add Apertura Air Blower for Lens Cleaning - BULB to your order? It is has a beauty all by itself, like an Ansel Adams photo.

Compared to the 7nm ZWO filters, the Astrodons had only slightly longer exposures. To close the loop here -- the answer is a resounding yes. Omg. I research what I could find. These are very close together spectrally. You are of course welcome to use those, its your gear, but they are not needed. Thats why our unbiased, non-commissioned product advisors only incentive is to recommend a product that they truly believe is the right choice to help you meet your goals, and at a price point that also meets your budget.   David Astro. Other filter suppliers try to "force fit" their orange filter (designed for the interline KAI11000, KAI2000 sensors) for use with these full-frame sensors. At the end of that thread I posted a set of data collected on the Alnitak region with the ZWO filters and my ASI1600MM-C camera with all the fixes for the hardware to get those filters working. This is why our >90%T guarantee is so important, even though it becomes very costly to manufacture. Customers should communicate directly with the manufacturer regarding details of their warranty, as warranties have a tendency to change without notice. The guaranteed >90% transmittance at the emission wavelength provides you with the highest signal available. Please place your order now, so that we may take into account your order and deliver the article to you by the above-mentioned date. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk. The narrow 5 and 3 nm bandwidths enhance contrast of emission targets by lowering your background signal. TheI-Seriesfilters compensate for the lower red response of these Interline detectors affecting the design of the Green and Red filters. Several functions may not work. In the case that this article currently is not available from the warehouse, please note the following: we order from this supplier in regular intervals. If you want the look of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, such as the famous Pillars of Creation (the Eagle Nebula, Messier 16), then the next filter to consider adding to your collection after H-a and OIII is the SII (es-two) or sulfur Special offer  Get 50% off any (or all) filter sets, when you buy any Atik mono camera (with the exception of the Atik GP).The SHO narrow band filter set is compatible with our filter wheels and allows astrophotographers to capture deep-sky objects in f/2 Highspeed Filterset consisting of 3 Filter: H-alpha, O III and S II. OIII (ohthree) emits light near 500 nm and is a blue-green- or teal-colored filter. Please use another browser such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari for the best experience. The data was taken at a camera temperature of -20C. With a guaranteed transmittance of more than 90% at the emission wavelength providing the highest available signal, combined with such spectrally narrow bandwidth filters, imagers can be confident of attaining maximum contrast. Following the additions of the H-Alpha and OIII filters, the next filter you'll need to add to your collection is the SII or Sulfur II filter, especially if you want to view Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images like the popular "Pillars of Creation" (Eagle Nebula, Messier 16). Lastly, Astrodon Narrowband filters are coated to the edge of the part and are edge blackened. With the Baader (OIII in particular) it was a processing nightmare cleaning it all up. Each filter is constructed using a highly innovative process with a single high quality 3 mm thick fused silica substrate and full hard oxide sputtered coatings. Glad to hear you are excited to get more data with your Astrodon filters. The basic imaging set of 5 filters becomes LRGBH-. Random tests of a competitors low-cost 7 nm H- filter showed %T values ranging from 86% down to 71%. All the filters were nicely labled on the edge. This is critical to minimize stray light for a filter that blocks most light except for the narrow bandpass.                             picture accurately reflects the product described by the title and description before you place Their blue and green color weights are no longer balanced and as a result, the OIII color in planetary nebula is skewed strongly toward blue, rather than the correct teal color. Yes, our filters are more expensive, but you always know what you are getting with Astrodon Narrowband filters  the best performance in the market  guaranteed. We look forward to helping you start your astronomy journey!
