There's an integrated handle for toting the speaker, but the PartyBox 110 is pretty hefty, weighing in at 23 pounds and measuring slightly more than 22 inches tall. Here's how to make them vanish. You can pair your phone and play music via the cube-shaped speaker, but also plug in a guitar and blend yourself in to jam along.

You can tweak the sound profile (with EQ settings) and upgrade the speaker's firmware in Anker's Soundcore companion app for iOS and Android. I didn't test the stereo mode, but I was impressed with the sound of a single PartyBox 110 -- this bluetooth device puts out lots of well-defined bass with good overall clarity in the highs and mids -- and I suspect that pairing two of these together would be pretty awesome. This is your best bet if you want a portable speaker that can deliver big, quality sound and operates on battery power. Plays slightly louder: The Xtreme 3's rated output power is 2 x 25W versus the Xtreme 2's 2 x 20W. Also, the speaker weighs about 1.5 pounds more (13 pounds or 5.9 kg), which means the added weight went into other components besides the battery, which is the same capacity. Anker's original Soundcore Motion Boom speaker (see below) has been on this list for a while and is still a decent value at a little more than $100. The Move streams music over your Wi-Fi network, but it can also function as a Bluetooth speaker when you take it outside. However, the few that do prove to be worth the investment come with long battery life, a practical design that is either portable friendly or sits handsomely on your coffee table and deliver the kind of sound quality to make a musical connection on par with thebest headphones.

No, it can't fuel a trance dance party on its own, but its sound clarity is impressive, and it has a fun extra bass button that adds some surprising, if slightly muddy, thump. Sometimes, being small and easy to carry is the most important quality in a Bluetooth speaker. The UE Hyperboom is the best Bluetooth speaker for large gatherings, thanks to its massive size and big, booming audio output. While the power rating is a little higher for the Boombox 2, its top volume is about the same as the original. Every Bluetooth speaker on this list delivers great sound and functionality, but only the LG XBoom Go PL7 does it while boasting awesome LED lights. The 16-hour battery is replaceable, and it also has replaceable wood and cloth elements. But it's not the kind of thing you'd want to throw in a backpack. Updated June 2022: We've added the Positive Grid Spark Mini, and information about the upcoming KEF LSX II Wireless. The IPX7-rating also means that it's protected for up to 30 minutes in the shower or pool. Positive Grid's Spark Mini (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite portable tools for musicians.

The JBL Charge 5 makes only a few changes to the Charge 4's formula, but thanks to the new model's improved sound output and even greater ruggedness, it's a deserving member of the best Bluetooth speaker club. At $250, Bang & Olufsen's round, IP67-rated Bluetooth speaker has a luxe price tag, but it's one of the best-sounding small speakers we've ever heard. This portable and rugged sound blaster is still our best Bluetooth speaker overall. However, it costs $50 more. It also can be used as a backup battery to charge your smartphone or other mobile device. Instead of a built-in handle, a detachable shoulder strap is included. JBL's second-generation Boombox 2 doesn't really look different from the original. There was a problem. This is a better option than the Sonos if you have no interest in a future home network of speakers. It's boxy and understated, and it looks a little more at home indoors. It has a wider soundstage with slightly more bass and clarity. While it's just 4 inches square, the StormBox Micro has pretty impressive bass, especially for something its size. With 20-ish hours of battery and an IPX7 waterproof ratingwhich means it's not dust-proof but can be submerged in waterit's a great companion for backyard tunes, a trip down the river, or other informal gatherings. We just wish JBL would have engineered the Link 20 to take calls. You also get a mic/guitar rear input and dual USB-out ports for charging your devices. Released in 2021, the PartyBox 110 packs some serious punch and delivers bigger sound than some of the portable boombox speakers on this list, including JBL's own Boombox 2 (see below). In this update, Tribit has maintained the rugged IP67 rating against water and dust, and given us more battery life (around 12 hours) and better bass. Rated for 100 watts of power (we always take power ratings with a grain of salt), the speaker doesn't have quite the volume or sound quality of the step-up PartyBox 110 (see below). This includes unlimited access to WIRED.com and our print magazine (if you'd like). The Trance Go is essentially that speaker without the integrated LEDs that allow you to create a mini light show. We spend several hours listening to music, making calls and toting around every speaker to make sure it sounds great across all music genres, provides solid call quality and withstands minor bumps or splashes. It's fun and easy to ask an Amazon Echo or Google Nest speaker to play your favorite track or tell you the weather, but smart speakers have a few crutchesfirst and foremost, stable Wi-Fi. Be sure to follow ourback to school guidefor all of your shopping needs this season. You can also link it wirelessly to the latest UE Bluetooth speakers to spread out the sound across a wider area. Running out of juice when you're streaming music in the yard or at a park? We shot a hose at it, so we know it can handle getting wet. At fewer than 4 inches wide, the only thing smaller than the Go 3 might be its price; even the Anker Soundcore 2 might sweat when seeing this speaker's price tag. For its size, the speaker is able to put out a lot of sound and mostly manages to avoid distorting at higher volumes (I tended to keep the volume in the 50%-to-75% range). Intelligent algorithms use data from a built-in mic to analyze where you've placed the speaker, ensuring the best possible sound, much like the Sonos Move.

It can't compete against bigger and more expensive speakers likeJBL's Boombox 2($400) andUltimate Ears' Hyperboom($400), but it packs a lot more volume and punch than more compact Bluetooth speakers like JBL's Flip 5 that cost around the same. While I liked the JBL's sound a bit more because it came across as sounding a little clearer with better detail, the Sony pumps out a lot of bass -- it has a warmer, boomier sound quality that some people may prefer. That way you can change the music using your voice, rather than controlling the audio through your phone. These smart features will not work beyond your homes Wi-Fi, so opt for a non-smart Bluetooth speaker for the beach or other outdoorsy locales.
