Call Laticrete to find out if the spectralock1 is approved for use in a steam shower. Is this something that sounds like  it will work well for that? Notify me of follow-up comments by email. If you have highly polished granite or marble thats important. You can use either, one will be just as durable as the other once cured. Yes, those are huge grout lines for that tile. Is this a stacked stone random tile? Unsanded and sanded are the two basic types of grout, but not all products are created equal. The mesh backing on tiles these days is crap. My son told me all the cool kids are doin it! I recommend you repair any grout and/or silicone that had mildew growth in it, then keep a spray bottle in ur shower or bathroom. Urine is an acid, which will eventually corrode the salts in cementitious products. Do you have any experience with the single component urethane (or similar) grouts like Quartzlock2, Mapei Flexcolor CQ, or Custom Fusion? Approx. I was very worried about using Fusion, we did a ton of research as to weather it was viable in a water environment. I was afraid of that. For a better experience, please enable JavaScript in your browser before proceeding. In various places on the floor and shower, a wet toothbrush will seem to corrode the grout (dark color water runs down, with tiny specks of grout in it).
