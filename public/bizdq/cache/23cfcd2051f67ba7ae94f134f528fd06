The opposite end is a flat, chisel style end that is also made from silicone rubber and is flexible enough to help apply glue with just the right amount of touch and finesse when needed. Please contact us ASAP if your order contains other products that you may need faster. The pack includes a fine tip brush, a chiseled tip brush and a flat tapered tip brush. The SILI Glue Pod features a sloped, rounded interior base that funnels your glue into place at the bottom of the Pod.

Before applying Renia  Rehagol the material needs to be ground and cleaned from dust. Each brush has the same profile on each end with one silicone rubber tip and the handle end is rigid in comparison. More on our policies here. It also works for thinning any of Renia's other solvent-based contact adhesives, and can be used for cleaning glue pots, brushes, and applicators.

The truth is, Acid Glue Brushes can be used for applying wood glue, white school glue, soldering flux, grease, oil, chemical, acid based materials and they can also be used to clean delicate objects like small camera lenses, computer keyboards and a whole lot more! Flexible enough to work like a brush for spreading across larger areas, but firm enough to serve as a spatula for removing excess adhesive. If this happens, Renia'ssolvent\/thinner product can be used to reconstitute your glue. The SILI Chiseled Tipped Micro Brush is perfect for small joinery, gaps and tight fitting corners. If you want to clean the brush right away, simply run it under warm water and work the excess glue off with your fingers.

The SILI Glue Pod features a sloped, rounded interior base that funnels your glue into place at the bottom of the Pod. The applicators can be used with Colle de Cologne and other solvent-based adhesives, but we have found that it can be difficult to control the amount of adhesive being applied when working in small areas and edges.

Whether you're using wood glue, school glue or mixing epoxy, if you don't have a place to put the glue while working, it can become messy. The Glue Spreader kit comes in a convenient 6 pack of multi colored spreaders / applicators. The unique formulation of an adhesive already premixed with a heat-activated cross-linker allows reactivation of the dried adhesive film at any time, while offering an extremely high resistance against environmental influences.
