I also have a regular Baking Stone made by Best I got from Sur La Table that I have used for a couple of years. they are super easy to make so it shouldnt cost anything at all. I've used unglazed quarry tiles for years in my oven--I just leave them there all the time. I couldn't wrap my brain around anything that wasn't a large slab (IE: quarry tiles, bricks, very small rocks) so my choices seemed to be kiln-bottoms or Firbrament. When I brought it home for the fist time and started preheating the oven with it inside, it started producing a lot of smoke and that burning oil smell. I finally broke down and bought a FibraMent stone. Anywho, thanks in advance for any insight. yes, granite and soapstone work, marble may or may not work, no, slate doesn't work, of which more presently. I was wondering if anyone can advise me. Do you remove the oven tiles for regular baking/cooking? thanks so much and the bread looks terrific. You have encouraged me to try this. Both are about 1/2" to 5/8" thick. Blake and Nick live in Chicago and have written for The Paupered Chef and other publications since 2006. Tiles don't have much thermal mass anyway. I was in the tile industry (installations) for 20+yrs While I don't know the answer to this, and I doubt everyone would agree if this is a good idea. I also use the iron-skillet on the last shelf with boiling water method for steaming. This post and all my others are just my $.02. The small ones are quite thin and naturally do not conduct heat as well as a single, continuous, heavy stone or tile. that said, i am still very much of the opinion that tools matter, and that people who have more than a passing commitment to bread baking -- like anyone who's passionate about a creative pastime -- ought to invest in the best tools they can afford -- no matter where they acquire them. I imagine I could flip the saucer upside down if I didn't want to deal with getting my boules over the lip. What section of home depot are those in? It can be very confusing. i think that we all ought to use the best we can afford -- afford being the operative term here. it would be SILLY to buy the expensive one. Good luck! I found a 12"x12" tile at Homedepot but the clerk said he didn't know if it contained any harmful substances. This is what this specific tile lists. What about just using fire brick, it is expensive up here but then it has all ready been shipped. Now that I am seriously looking at getting tiles for my oven do you remove them or leave them in for regular baking and cooking (cookies, pot roast, etc.)? Having worked for a number of years for one of the world's largest manufacturers of industrial refractory products I know that industrial refractories often contain, and can leach, materials which you do not want to ingest (or breath as vapors) under any circumstances. I grew up with a dad that did woodworking, some metalworking, and NEVER that I can ever remember, took a family vehicle to a mechanic. I realize I'm jumping in kind of late here, but I know of at least one pizzeria whose oven deck contains asbestos. If you like I can produce numerous documents that prove my point. I actually just leave mine in there all the time. Some had a polished surface, with very few 'inclusions' and were often used indoors; about 10-12" was a popular size for 'hacienda'-style homes.They required a fair bit of 'finishing' by the builder or homeowner after being laid. Sometimes, you only need a tool once, or perhaps a dozen times on a single job. I'd also like to see what the famous 'quarry tiles', etc, look likeI knew what that meant in 'Australian English' when I lived in Australia. if you really want to get fancy, usually where you can find kiln shelves you can find potters. I live in a small city and feared there would be none close enough to warrant this venture, but I found one about 10 minutes away. It does need to be bone dry and needs to be warmed slowly and thoroughly before you take it up to high temp. Thus it has other things in it besides clay. Don't know if this will help, however, when I was looking for unglazed tiles at Lowe's I found a brand that seemed OK. Both are made in the US and I couldn't tell any difference - love the results from both. He also said they can be left in the oven rather than having to remove it after use. yes, unglazed tiles work. I haven't heard any reports that unglazed quarry tiles are unsafe for cooking on. We were given one of the fancy, rectangular pizza stones when we got married in 1996 and we have used it once (or more!) Mine, in fact, came out exactly at $2.98. [1] The Hearthstone works very well for me when I preheat it to 525 using the convect setting, but it is very large, heavy, and expensive. He said the tile being porous is key; I think he said something about it absorbing water. Btw, how long does it take to heat up/ preheat a tile prior to baking? I don't use them, so don't know much about them, but it looks like they are six, 6 x 6" tiles arranged on oven shelf: I think this is a typical color, but not necessarily the only color used. The ingredients in those can vary a lot, and heating them may not be salubrious. I do believe his lazy susan rotating base to be quite patentable, outside of that, it`s a single pizza oven that many,including myself have built and have posted many pics of. Is this suitable? I'll try different configurations to see what results they produce but I think it was a good start. now, admittedly, i'm in the business of selling baking stones, among other things, and i have a financial interest in what people buy and who they buy it from, but that said, a great stone -- whether you buy from me or someone else -- is an investment that's literally going to last several lifetimes (as long as you don't try to bounce it) and will help you bake great bread. Just a thought. As a consumer, there are few assurances that the materials produced for a non food application are safe for contact with food. They are pretty cheap at the home stores and I think I've only had to replace one in the last eight years. One or two a year might break, but at $1 or less each at home improvement stores, they're easy to replace. When you go this route, be sure to choose tiles that have not been glazed. He buys the best ones, individuallyhe always chooses HSS over Carbon steel, or carbide over HSS, if available. not as cheap. I remove them, if for no other reason than it seems like it takes more time and energy to heat the oven when they are in there. I covered two shelves in my home quality electric range for les than $15.00. All tiles need to be, at first, heated slowly to purge moisture from the inside of the tile, spending some time heating it at lower, but incrementally higher temperatures working up to the desired temperatures. and while you may or may not be intending the "for those who can afford it" without saying it outright, IMO it doesn't show through. Quite frankly, I would be surprised if a patent was granted, and I have a couple of patents myself. It gets scraped with a spatula (if necessary) and then wiped down with a soapy rag, but it never gets washed like a plate. They run like a dollar at the hardware store. I do leave them in the oven all the time (not the box, just the ones I'm using :-P ). Enjoy making wonderful bread and home baked goods. I am free where ever I am to build an exact copy of of say a Fender Stratocaster guitar, I just can`t sell it as a Fender Stratocaster guitar. Go to home depot and pick up an unglazed saltillo tile, I'd be surprised if it was more than $2. Just always make sure you put it in the oven before you turn the oven on. I bought a big flat piece of slate and I am having it cut to fit the oven.
