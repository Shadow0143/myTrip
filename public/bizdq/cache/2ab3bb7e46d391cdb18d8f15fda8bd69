Both have merits. Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning, Ethical and green living with Lucy Siegle, 'Rather than choosing between the two, look for both, as paper products increasingly offer both FSC-certified virgin fibre and recycled content (also certified)': Lucy Siegle on environmentally friendly paper. However, recycled paper is NOT sustainable paper, Recycling additionally encourages the use of paper. Those chemicals and different solids (such as the ink itself and small fibres) still make their way into the landfill and potentially our water. If youre not sure what youre looking for, you may be paying more for paper that isnt any more environmentally-friendly than the virgin paper which is made from fresh trees. Daily newspapers and weekly magazines are usually not suitable. Anecdotal evidence from the paper industry suggests that printers are put off by hefty fees to certify as FSC.  Products made from 100% recycled content are usually of a lower quality than those from virgin fibres. Producing recycled paper requires many more additional steps which include: Used paper collection and recovery process: Sorting and preparation to remove adhesives or staples that may be attached to the paper which must be removed before it can be processed, Once thats complete, recycled paper must then go through pulping, and then to a de-inking facility (as most printing inks are not water soluble) to remove the ink and prevent the finished product from looking 'dirty.'.           This is crucial: forests support 1.6 billion of the poorest people in the world. For instance, if youre going to make recycled paper for use in office photocopiers, youll need waste office paper to begin with. I suggest that rather than choosing between the two you look for both, as paper products increasingly offer both FSC-certified virgin fibre and recycled content (also certified). Recycled paper that is white may be made of paper that was bleached the first time it was processed, or it may be bleached during the recycling process.                                                                                                      Paper used in stationery products is often a blend of virgin and recycled fibres. Here are a few facts to consider that may answer that question: Recycled paper has a more complex production process than brand new (virgin) paper, and those extra steps equate to more costs: With brand new paper, there are only 3 steps in the production process: logging, milling and distribution. This creates the highest quality pulp and has characteristics that make it ideal for sustainability. These recycled fibres are processed to make paper products similar to those made from original (virgin) wood fibres.               These penalties can include the use of transport fuel used in the collection and transport of paper over long distances. So which part of the production process is it best to encourage: regenerating forests or recycling paper? The best sustainability model is initially earth-friendly.                                                                                                      Product and brand credibility would be at risk if a supplier chose to make incorrect claims about the paper they sold.           Should you use recycled paper in your print jobs?

Bangalore 560058, Recycled Handmade Paper With labels like 100% recycled, post-consumer, and 100% recyclable, (and equally diverse prices for various papers), it can be hard to tell whether your purchase is environmentally responsible enough to warrant the extra expense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  When most people consider using sustainable paper, their first idea is using recycled paper. (Certification of a papers origin is done by an independent authority such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)). Fortunately, the modern processes for extracting virgin fibres are biomass energy self-sufficient. The bottom line: if youre concerned with eco-friendly paper, post-consumer recycled is the best choice for you. Check percentages: buy the highest level of "post-consumer waste paper"  aim for 100%. (Driving bundles of waste paper between cities is expensive in a country this big). To be truly sustainable, ecological, social, and economic sustainability must work together.

These products may be marketed as having various levels of recycled fibre content up to 100%. Virgin paper requires the felling and milling of trees. You are trying to choose between two different systems of producing less wasteful paper. But the WWF still considers FSC certification the only credible one (above the purely recycled). We also "get it"  put the paper in the recycling bin, close the loop by buying recycled, and hey presto: virgin trees have been saved. That depends on what type of recycling or repurposing the paper went through before you bought it. Because they believe it is the most responsible and environmentally friendly thing to do. There has been a decline in global deforestation, thanks partly to the increased use of recycled paper and the purchasing of paper products that are certified as coming from responsibly managed forests. But is it really better for the environment? How GPS Works? As consumers, many people are aware that it often costs more to buy renewable or recycled products vs. conventionally produced products, and paper is no exception to that rule.
