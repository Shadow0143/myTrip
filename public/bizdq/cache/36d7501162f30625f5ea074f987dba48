By far one of the best car seats Ive owned and now on two of them!! Lugging a car seat around is no fun for anyone. Im still getting used to them though. (like everyone in the world). We both hate it. Love this seat for its easy install and no thread adjustable harness. In the registration process the country options are limited to North America only. I bought this BRITAX? Of course we could have gone with less expensive car seats, being that it is only used occasionally in grandma and grandpa's car, but decided not to. The car seat was easy to install with the help of a YouTube video tutorial. Hi Hilda, thank you for your enquiry, the difference between the Trek and the Boulevard Exclusive is that all of the other colours under the Boulevard Exclusive are Exclusive to us and aren't sold anywhere else. Super easy to install, comfortable and safe for our babies! Be it a need for a lifestyle change, flexible working hours, developing a territory, building a franchise business that is all yours or simply to help expectant mothers make the right informed decisions to suit their lifestyle.
