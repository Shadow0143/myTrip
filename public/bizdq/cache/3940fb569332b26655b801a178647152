I own neither of these guitars, only a jagstang and i'm perfectly at ease with the bridge on that guitar. The changes to the sound are subtle, but noteable. Tell me, how do you intonate the bottom three strings on a mastery when the 1st saddle is supposed to be (to be intonated) back,the 2nd forward and the 3rd back? Maybe due to the different distance to the treble-pole-piece, maybe due to the increased sustain, maybe due to the combination of both, the guitar sounds different, especially on the neck pick-up. Apparently they recently stopped shipping outside of the UK though so it might be difficult to get ahold of one. . Well, as said before, the Mastery Bridge really adds sustain, and the treble strings sound beefier. BTW,OSG is the best place for hyped up products IMO if that's what you're after. Its not very time consuming. I dont think people are particularly against it, just not for it. Or, looking at it from another angle: For the price of a stompbox (how many youve been through in recent years trying to get more out of your sound?) The inside diameter on Mexican made thimbles are slightly smaller and require our standard MT thimbles installed for our M1 bridge to work. The mastery has been classed as "the perfect bridge" by a lot of rich folk but it has at least one design flaw, you. I think the bridge has many advantages like the increased sustain, the tuning-stability, the feel while palm-muting, the not-slipping strings, and some disadvantages (or better: compromises) like the fixed spacing and the not-so-easy intonation setup with 3 strings over one saddle, but to me the sonic improvements win. Post spacing, post size, bushing size and tolerances vary greatly on these mostly Korean made bridges and we do not make threaded style mounting posts as they do not function as well as standard USA style thimbles with our original post design. Includes our M1 Mastery Bridge with standard US mounting posts and a set of two vintage spec MT 303 Stainless Steel thimbles to replace your stock thimbles. This is nothing special to the Mastery Bridge, the same happens with Tune-O-Matic style and the stock bridge. IT IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!!! The montage was really easy, the setup instructions are easy to follow and with a little bit of knowledge of the principles involved and the feel in the fingertips its easy to get the right setting (back) after swapping to the Mastery Bridge (*please see the update below, with the help of John W/Mastery Bridge I was able to get more out of the bridge. Please read over this entire page for information on our body thimbles and your guitar. Mustang bridge, Mastery and Staytrem all have deeper slots for the strings so they will stay put. Fran said: I just did my monthly visit of OSG classifieds and noticed a few Mastery Bridges surfacing in there. You rarely go wrong following Ron Kirn's advice. It takes some mileage to get used to the new feel.see update below. I used to have a rather spread-out spacing with the original bridge, esp. One thing I did not mention before; the guys at Mastery Bridge are incredibly helpful. ***writes a letter to santa asking for a Mastery Bridge***  <---- only way I'd get one. If I recall, the 50th Anniversary Jags are MIJ, and while I've never had a problem making the MIJ/CIJ Jag bridge work, I've found they are distinctly lesser in quality when compared to the AVRI piece. Of all the Fender forums OSG.com seems to be the only place that has embraced this bridge, which i think is a reflection of the user age group. As you may can tell from the pictures, the bridge had one of the saddle-screws come loose, lowering the saddle in the middle, which led to a slightly detuned guitar in the middle of a song and something which I never encountered with the stock bridge. Is there a secret to easy threading of strings with a top-loading bridge? *) Let me get this straight: The spacing on the Mastery Bridge is not thinner or wider than the stock bridges spacing. Vintage style thimbles found on this model are fairly easy to replace. The only Issue i could see the Mastery curing is the bridge moving while you play, mine does that, and I have very little if any tuning issues with either of my *stangs, and they seem to hold in place fine under my super light strings so there's that one for me.

M1-KIT: M1 Mastery Bridge and set of MT Mastery Thimbles I still have the 1970 Mustang that was my first guitar. My advice, try the guitar first, and get it setup properly. That is to say, played unplugged. Problems solved. Am i being too picky in regards to a dead spot on a suhr? Ive been playing Jazzmasters for 20+ years, why are you set on swapping the bridge? Its a pity that you cant try before buy to see/hear if the changes are worth the investment to you, sound-liking being such a personal thing. Please review our specs page for more information about our thimbles. Really solid and chunky, no rattles at all and it just exudes quality.

People jumped on them and took the bait that it was the "best" bridge around, without even thinking about it and handed over $160 for it. M1-KIT: M1 Mastery Bridge and set of MT Mastery Thimbles In fact, if you have a certain combination of bridge- and saddle-height, chances are that you cannot have the correct string position on the original bridge, because the intonation-screw will contact with the string exactly in this position  causing buzz or making it unplayable in that position.

I think its a little out of my league price wise especially considering gotoh and replacement fender bridges are only $20-$40. Setting the intonation is not difficult, but it takes some patience and I think its ok to say that as a best practice one should start with the center-position strings of the two saddles  since the saddles each share three strings youll be in setup-hell if you start with one of the outer strings  its intonation will be affected by the position of the other two strings.

My well used Jaguar and Jazzmaster's bridge do just fine, and those are the only two guitars I can see having any sort of issues a Mastery might fix (in particular, string slippage).
