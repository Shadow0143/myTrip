As pressure on the worlds forests and the surrounding eco-systems increases due to unsustainable agriculture, the expansion of infrastructure and illegal logging, it is time to take an even more holistic approach to protect and support these important resources for generations to come. Responsible wood sourcing and forest management ensure that the needs of people dependent on forests are met, that businesses can work sustainably, that forest ecosystems are protected and biodiversity is enhanced. We are on a journey to improve global forest management and make responsible wood sourcing the industry standard, contributing to building resilient forest landscapes and improve biodiversity. Forests contribute to maintaining balance in the atmosphere, purify the air that we breathe and are part of the water cycle. In 2012, we set a goal that by 2020 our wood would be from more sustainable sources.  They provide sources of food, fuel, timber and many other ecosystem services that we rely upon.
