My oldest original print dates from around 1920. I would not want to be a conservator!!!!!! 	785 Tucker Road, Suite G-183 		 To spare stress on the crank handle, I also push on the bed a bit as I crank. 		The Masters 		 So, here's my prediction: I suspect that if you ink an etched plate on the inkier side, and use some good padding like a thick felt cushion blanket, the laminator will handle it pretty well. Hi Michael! I wish I had the equipment in my studio to get back into that, but the chemicals are hard to deal with. This all makes the framing and display of digital fine art and photos much more viable, but there still remain issues over heat tolerances when mounting. The change is not visible at normal viewing angles, but if you see the reflection of a strong light source in the print, it is clearly visible, and that bothers me somewhat. This issue is especially noticeable on prints made on gloss, semi-gloss and luster coated photo (RC) papers. Post update: Ive gotten many questions about how the laminator performs with various kinds of plates. This press is a simple, easy-to-use tool that can be used with a variety of materials to dry mount, laminate, or reinforce all types of photographs an For safe mounting of artwork to paper. Is it possible to use the heat mount press (with the heat switched off) for this? These blankets can add up to a thickness of 3/4 inch, which is the largest space that the laminator can have between the drums. For more articles on mounting basics look under the mounting section in Articles by Subject. While researching printers I also discovered a line of Epson dye ink printers, so my cover statement that all Epson printers are pigment is wrong. 		May 2016 Coated papers may be fine art or photo papers that have been treated with a receptor coating for inkjet printing. Common pigment only papers include Ilford Galerie Smooth and Epson papers. Hi Wendy! I mostly use Akua soy based inks, but just bought some Cranfield inks to try, and of course need to practice more for consistency in wiping. 		 Mountings are possible on nearly any type of media and flat backing board imaginable. Some good discussion here, thanks everyone for the replies. Important concept: don't think any of this will be easy until after you have some experience with it, and you have wasted some materials, and you have sworn some mighty oaths. We're proud to announce that G-Collective Studios is moving into a bigger and better facility! I would say that a 50 variable from the center of a platen to the edges is unacceptable after it has had time to equalize. DeMille epics that were pasted to decaying mounts that were soaking sulfur into the prints, but could not be removed as it would require soaking or steaming the mount, and 'ya can't get that dye transfer wet!!!!! But recent scientific and use tests have begun to show it is more likely a paper coating issue and not a technology issue after all. 		Tips And Tricks I've also put some registration marks on the pressure knobs, to help get the pressure even across the drums. I guess the other point over here is that accelerated aging tests show drymounted prints faring better - the drymount may not have been as archival as the print but it offered one more barrier against atmospheric pollutants. The laminator has pulled great prints from all of them! 		  Thanks very much. But I'm willing to try! I do have a new linocut print in the works, and I hope to take some video in the coming week. The test results indicated that thermal technology, as opposed to piezo inkjet technology, was what allowed for the heat sensitivities when dry mounting. 		 Im by no means an expert printmaker, but if you have questions please leave them below, and Ill try my best to answer. We tried a few different methods and eventually worked it out. Hi again Will, I did test out an old flat bit plate, and after some trial and error with pressure and inking managed to pull a decent print. www.pacificmount.com/products/laminators-and-accessories. When properly printed and stored, dye-based inkjet and dye diffusion thermal transfer prints have light stability equal to traditional photographic C-prints (chromogenic, RC). Requesting a blank or discarded image on the same photo paper will easily determine a heat sensitive swellable paper by adding a drop of water. Using the GBC SpireIII Roller Laminator (RL) in conjunction with pressure-sensitive (PS) adhesive film, we are able to create a strong, long-lasting bond without the use of heat, which can damage some sensitive pieces. Hot mounting (aka dry mounting) is very unlikely to produce any air bubbles under the print, it is absolutely permanent, and it has withstood the test of time. Mounting is also an affordable way to display your prints at your next gallery showing, allowing the buyer to make final decisions upon framing options. My own private testing for the framing industry began in 1996 (Heat Tolerance Test #1) with a study of heat tolerances of electrophotographic and electrostatic toner copies under dry mount temperatures ("Digital Heat Tolerances", February 2002). I see the 3mm black PVC also comes with the self stick adhesive. 		 Good luck with yours! Do not allow the adhesive to contact the artwork itself. Almost all of our FIne-Art & Photo papers and Canvas are archival certified for 100-200+ years and many are OBA Free. Browse through a full selection of our available MEDIA to read descriptions and see detailed photos of all the substrates we currently carry. I  was wondering how you wen t about fastening the laminator to the birch plywood? The reason I want to move away from heat mounting is that it changes the surface of the glossy Fuji Crystal Archive paper in a certain way - makes it sort of splotchy looking in spite of the use of the glossy ColorMount Cover Sheet. Our mounting specialists come to us with decades of experience and that experience, combined with our 35+ years in the framing industry sets us apart from the competition. Dry mounting should be used only for reproductions and commercial artwork, where conservation is not a priority. Instructions on how to enable JavaScript in your web browser.

Do you think the rollers would apply enough pressure for etching prints? 		August 2013 Hi Aaron, Resin-coated is not really a coating at all, but rather a way in which the paper is constructed. It would also be great to see your drill press handle alteration! Uncoated papers contain a wide range of weights and surface textures. 		 You aren't going to have any protection, at least I don't see any glass or acrylic in front of the print.  		April 2015 Right is Lanaquarelle HP, and uncoated DFA paper. So what? I'd love to hear how it goes for you if you give the laminator a try. 		 Expected availability: 7-10 business days.

Printmaking A real press has a heavy metal bed that rolls back and forth between the drums to support a plate and paper, and several specialized felt blankets to cushion the work and spread the pressure evenly. Photo 3: Swellable Coated vs. Uncoated DFA 		December 2015 Shayok another problem with your temperature variance is that Nielsen/Bainbridge states that their foam core board will melt at temperatures over 220 degrees. That is a good point and important to consider. It requires no moisture, glue, heat,  Made from polypropylene, Lineco Archival Mounting Corners are free of harmful chemicals that might damage photos and artwork, and feature a pressure-s Scotch's Positionable Mounting Adhesive is a special synthetic adhesive that allows material to be positioned and repositioned for accurate alignment, For easy, accurate mounting of photos, paper, cardstock, plastic, and more, choose Grafix Artist-tac  the adhesive that goes only where you wan No adhesive or tape. Coupled with Canon's LUCIA EX 12-pigment ink system, your prints are guaranteed to be fade resistant, scuff resistant and long lasting. The print is far less likely to become creased or torn. Swellable coatings react differently to dye or pigment and in turn colors may vary a great deal in final printed images (photo 4). All of that gave me a base so that I could use C clamps to clamp the laminator to a tabletop so it won't move. It was my job to do the copy work, but some of the old mounted works would send a chill down my spine!!! Each 8x10" photo has been divided into six strips and tested for heat tolerance at F 150, 170, 185, 200 and laminated at 225. Until galleries start calling me about my prints I'm not too worried about the collectible or archival nature of mounting them. Understanding I have been teaching about digital printing technologies in relation to framing and mounting for ten years now, and little by little we seem to have a better understanding of them. When mounting to substrates which are non-porous (such as DiBond or Acrylic) or when mounting items which are heat sensitive, we utilize Cold Mounting techniques. This silicone-treated paper can be used as a cover sheet in most dry mounting and laminating jobs. 		August 2015 	chris@designsinkart.com. Ive had good results using a piece of 3/16 foam core as a bed, and Ive also used a sheet of plexiglas and masoniteall are fine. At least the back is sealed from atmospheric contaminants. Then there are the coated DFA and photo papers that will work with either dye or pigment inks including Crescent Digital Papers, and Hahnemuhle Photo Rag. I use a sheet of plexi as a press bed now, rather than foam core as I used to. Your first attempts will not be a walk in the park, and the results may not be pretty. It  may not display this or other websites correctly. 		January 2016 View Full Version : Adhesive for cold mounting fiber prints. Mounting corners, strips, and sleeves provide an archival option for cold mounting of photos and other materials in photo albums, scrapbooks, and presentation books. 		 At one end of the uncoated paper spectrum is 20# to 26# lightweight bond paper used as everyday printer paper. So Ive left out the thick cushion blanket, and use only two blankets: the catcher is a very thin pressed all-wool felt that I purchased from a specialty printmaking supply shop, and the pusher blanket is a thicker wool felt that I got at a local fabric store. Find products for dry mounting photos such as presses for mounting photos and more on fine art paper, metal, wood, and more. Aside from straight dye and pigment, there is also a third hybrid category of ink which combine both dye and pigment. If you like to print LARGE, you know that your prints can be quite expensive and cumbersome to frame. Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass. They create a set of pores that act as inkwells trapping the ink just below the coating surface. 		Center top HP Glossy Premium Photo Paper has a yellow tint; upper right Jetprint Premium Photo Paper has a green tint; lower right Ilford Galerie Classic Gloss is closest to the original photo color; lower left Epson Colorlife Photo appears very green. Also has a non-stick, coated base. I'll try to post some pictures and maybe video of the press in use in the next week or so; I have a student here who will be doing some printmaking so that may be a good opportunity to get some pictures. 		 Dyes have a wider color gamut and greater saturation, but are water soluble (photo 8). The other end is mouldmade, fine art paper such as Arches, Rives BFK, and Somerset. I will definitely let you know how it goes once I begin printing. I've got my share of mucilage-glued albumens and cyanotypes well over a hundred years old on plain bad cardboard. THE FLATTEST ALTERNATIVE FOR MOUNTING LARGE FORMAT PHOTOGRAPHS & PRINTS! I raised the top roller as far as it would go, and used only newsprint in place of blankets, but it worked. 		June 2015 Water droplets have a tendency to sit on the coating surface until the air evaporates it, with no resulting change to the paper once dry (photo 7). I guess I should write another post about the modifications to the press; I found a drill press handle online and we were able to get it to stay on reliably. If you will be hanging directly on the wall or will choose to mat and frame the mounted image, use a stiffer backing like DiBond, Sintra, foamcore, gatorboard or even wood. I believe people typically use a vacuum press for this kind of thing. You are using an out of date browser. It's even more floppy than typical matboard. These pores suck the ink droplets into the open spaces as the water in the ink evaporates (diagram 2). 		 Believe me, it would be helpful. If at all possible, my guess is one would be restricted to pieces that fit under the press in one pass - is that correct? The company was great about answering my questions (Um, no, we havent heard of anyone using it this way, but give it a try!), and the laminator is very affordableespecially compared to a real press which can run thousands of dollars. Photo 5: Water on Swellable Coating We also carryArtcare Restore&RagMountadhesives which both boast 100% acid free, lignin-free rag tissue carrier, Artcare Restore being the only adhesive on the market today that is not onlyremovablebut alsoreversibleand therefore considered of true Long-Term preservation standard, or"Archival". All books are available from Designs Ink Publishing through this website. There are two basic categories for inkjet inks: dye and pigment. I wouldn't do this with anything except a dye infused metal print. So I was excited to give it a spin. So, is 3mm PVC rigid enough for some 34x26" and maybe a 34x48"? We can work with you to develop the best combination of materials and approaches to fit your needs from the very beginning of your project to the finished, framed and ready-to-hang piece. 		 The Dry-Mounting method uses a heat activated adhesive tissue sandwiched between the photograph and a stiff backing board to achieve a permanent or semi-permanent bond. Good suggestions about the 'dry' glue. preservation techniques to be safe. 		Exhibitions I found a company in Washington State called Pacific Mount, which specializes in this kind of mounting and sells all the products you need: adhesives, boards of all sizes, and laminating machines. I've got some old drymounted photos more than 1/2 century old, from my high school photo class. It costs more in labor as well as materials, it is invasive, and it isn't usually necessary. It looks like a good setup for mounting prints but I can't seem to find any information on what pressure activated adhesive might work.
