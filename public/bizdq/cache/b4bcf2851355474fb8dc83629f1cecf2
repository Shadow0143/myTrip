But now that I have a garage I might end up putting the carseat in the garage. A strong mental storage unit / shed can keep your stroller safe from both harsh weather and thieves. Hang behind the door: A better idea is to hang it behind your door using hooks. Are you wondering whether the stroller will fit in or not? Strollers might be a huge eyesore for some people, even when folded. This will help you save space and time at the same time. This is the best option especially for the parents who dont want the stroller in the house. In this way you get the best of both worlds and you can keep it in your kids bedroom. For example, if rear seating is available then place any bags with wheels (e.g., roller board bag) between passenger seats so they can roll. That would be a smart idea. Or even people will full houses, do people usually keep them in the house, garage, etc? Anyone out there in condos or apartments, where do you keep your stoller/ car seat? We typically don't fold indoors because why be bothered and typically have items in the basket. So, if your car has a particularly tiny trunk, there are some compact stroller options that might fit more easily. Baby Room: A baby room can be a great option for storing a baby stroller.
