So you're getting an M.2 NVME drive and using the M.2 SATA drive with the adapter and regular SATA cable? Dunno Can the WWAN port take M.2 2230 NVMe SSDs, or is it limited to SATA only? Looking at the 5590 specs, I noticed that they apparently take both M.2 SATA and M.2 NVME drives in the M.2 slot. I can 99% guarantee that the M.2 SATA and regular SATA share the same SATA port which is why they can't both work. The M.2 MUST be an M.2 NVME (pcie) drive.
