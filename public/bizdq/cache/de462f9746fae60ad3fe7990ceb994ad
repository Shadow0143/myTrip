The 7-11 connected to the hotel used to be open 24/7 but now it closes at 8pm. There are lots of famous restaurants serving local dishes near these hotels. The hotel is very clean, it is a bit strange, this is not a quilt cover, but a piece of sheet between the two sheets is sandwiched by a core, which is a bit &#128517; fell asleep and was slipped out by the core, directly covered on the body, However, in general, even if the guest leaves the store, it is just a change of the sheets and not the core! The environment is beautiful and clean. Although this is adequate for simple tasks on the internet, personally I think hotels should offer at least 30 Mb/s as their minimum. The bathroom toilet is incredibly low. For the best experience on our site, be sure to turn on Javascript in your browser.
