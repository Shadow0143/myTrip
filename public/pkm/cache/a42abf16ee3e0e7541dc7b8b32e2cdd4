I just started making my own almond milk and your ideas for using the almond pulp are awesome. Thank you! Its worth a shot  let us know if you give it a try! I mixed the dry ingredients- I did 2/3 GF flour and 1/3 White Whole Wheat, then added wet pulp. Wonderful! Once firm, use a spatula to carefully separate the crackers to ensure they arent touching or too crowded. Will now spend some time looking at your other recipes. They feel very gourmet. Anyway, I used lots of dried rosemary and love the flavor. We havent tried with those modifications though. Please continue in the future with the substitutions! Thanks so much for the lovely review, were so glad everyone enjoys the crackers! Hi Luisa, good question! Is the purpose to bind? Hi Dana, instead of almond meal (Im allergic to that and all other nuts except pecans), can I use pecans? Im allergic to oats as well. I tried first exactly the way it was listed, then with rosemary and no garlic, basil and garlic, basil and rosemary and garlic. Have a question? I have done these several times always works well. Then I leveled up, by using whole grain flours (teff, oat, sprouted sorghum and brown rice). They definitely look and taste the part. The taste is mellow. If too wet, sprinkle on brown rice flour. Xo. Yum! Next time, would you mind leaving a rating with your review? I just slid the parchment off the sheet to cool on the counter. Though we havent tried it and cant guarantee results. Would love a heads up! Planning to try next week, they sound delicious and best recipe Ive found! ), Were so glad you enjoyed them, Jennifer! These are excellent crackers with Avocado oil or olive oil. Hope that helps! * 1 teaspoon ground dried garlic * 1 teaspoon good salt (I used Himalayan) These are my go-to cracker now! This was the first time I made crackers and they were delicious! I do not have flax or chia seeds on hand. This was delicious and worked out perfectly first time around. :), Do you by chance have a savoury lactation biscuit recipe? Thanks so much for the lovely review! The crackers will crisp up more as they cool. xo. Thanks! Hmm, that might be too wet. I am blown away at how good these are. Once theyre rolled out and sliced, a quick trip to the freezer helps them firm up to make transferring to the baking sheet a breeze. I wont be buying store bought crackers anymore as these were easy to make and much tastier. The only difference I could see was I didnt managed to get them to brown, is there anything else I should of done? I know the texture and moisture content would be a bit different between the almond flour and meal, so hoping it works. Do you think that could be the reason? But my bestie is allergic to almonds, citrus, gluten and dairy. I made these again and want to add praise for recipes versatility! Hi David, sorry for the confusion! Crispy, thin, gluten-free crackers reminiscent of Wheat Thins! Possibly pecan flour/ meal? I actually use olive because I am keen on the flavor. Right after cooling from the oven, mine have no taste. Love your site! I havent tried them with almond/oat flour. Love this recipe Rachel! If not, what minimum salt amount would you recommend? I want to make these !!!! Anyways, I wanted my first try to be a simple recipe, so I decided to use brown rice flour with ground flaxseeds for extra nutrients, and I added a small amount of maple syrup for flavor. Those 9 carbs, thats almost half of the carb allowance for many people on Keto. I substituted the flours and made a sweet cracker. Do you have an oil free version? Were so glad you enjoy them! These crackers are so yummy and simple. However, for making the Vegan GF crackers, I dont know if I should buy the Thank you so much. This recipe requiring just a food processor (or bowl!) Hey the recipe was amazing. Hi Mayen, pecan flour/meal could work. I think that adding more water (more or less doubled!) do you have the exact measurement for millet and arrowroot? We havent tried making these with domato flour, but if you give it a try, report back on how it goes! My only change was the addition of some lemon pepper as I like a bit of heat and it complements the rosemary flavor nicely. They turned out delicious! Cheers, friends! Really eliminates that gritty mouth feel thats such a turnoff. Do you think these would work without salt? Also, can I use chia seeds instead of flaxseed? Ill let you know how it goes! Its super helpful for us and other readers. Dr. Cate Shanahan has done a lot of research on this in case you want to look for more research. Thanks If I dont have Bobs Red Mill Superfine Almond Flour on hand, I run my almond flour for about 8-10 seconds, pulsing to make sure I dont make almond butter. from this recipe, the sky is the limit. Does it relate to a fan oven? And if so, do I just add to food processor with other flours and spices and pulse together? Perhaps it was the flour I was using, but I just ended up with a bunch of crumbs both times. He thoroughly enjoyed them! Thanks for the inspiration to try making my own crackers. I love this cracker! It works totally fine because they shrink away from each other anyway as they bake. Perfect for dipping in hummus, nut butters, and more! I was wondering if I could use all purpose flour instead of GF and if that would require any tweaks in the recipe? Thankyou for such clear instructions. The flower, flax meal and brewers yeast is the triple threat! Thank you! Followed directions  used oat flour. Only change up I made was instead of using garlic powder, I used onion powderstill turned out amazing! Thank you for the recipe. Love oats, but not what it can do to me. I used whole wheat flour and these are goooooooooood did not last long! The only thing that disappointed me, was that they didnt brown, even though I left them in longer than indicated. Has anyone tried making with chickpea flour (in place of DIY flour) and nut butter (in place of oil)? I cut the dough into 3 fluted circles and ended up with 60 crackers. so good and tasty!! Hi Id like to try these, but before I do I was wondering if it is necessary to transfer the out of the freezer crackers from one parchment lined baking sheet to another lined baking sheet before sticking them in the oven? First, they are delicious, and I usually hate gluten-free flavors. Its super helpful for us and other readers. Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. I wonder if something like nut butter might be able to bind, and then increase the water a little bit? I share vegan and gluten-free recipes because of past health issues. I bake mine a little longer to get a real crunch. Thankyou  I finally got crackers we all like! I had tried quite a few failproof cracker recipes before and non of them came out nearly right. Next time will be making milk so I can make more of these! I add a sprinkle of salt to the tops before baking them, as I see now that some other reviewers have tried successfully as well. Wonderful! Get discounted copies of my cookbookhere. They are always better, I think if I wait a couple of days to eat them. Guessing they were a hit! Ive used it for pancakes before and I quite like the taste. I also add a table spoon of nutricional yeast for that extra cheese flavour. This recipe really is quick and easy. :). Do you think I could use quinoa or chickpea flour instead of a gf blend? (Trust me. Im on a strict diet right now and this is actually allowed. Hope that helps! After making the vegan cheez-its a few times (trying to get perfect them) I tried these once. I didnt have any rosemary so I added Braggs Sprinkle (24 herbs and seasoning mix) and nutritional yeast. They werent crumbly at all and had the perfect crispiness. Oats do contain gluten. Its super helpful for us and other readers. This time Ive used amaranth flour.But each time Ive made them there is a sandy  ness in the mouth towards the end as though the flour has sand mixed. These would make the perfect snack to have on hand during the week. Looking forward to trying again with different herbs and spices. I changed the recipe up a little and it is insane!  Copyright 2022 - HealthierSteps. These crackers were so simple, and I didnt even have a rolling pin! Im making a double batch today as they are completely addictive! For more browning let them bake a smidge longer! Very good. Let us know how it goes! I made my first batch of these for my husband who is on an elimination diet. But still curious if you think this would work with other nuts. These are delish and so easy!! I make sure my rice flours are superfine by running each separately in my small Ninja processor for about 15-20 seconds. This recipe is for the carb and cracker lover who is ready to up their game and make their own at home. Instead of 3/4 cup gluten free flour, I used 1/4 c gluten free flour and 1/2cup tiger nut flour. Love the flavors! I used the 5 tbls spoons of water but only one piece of parchment. Thank you! Made it with sorghum flour and it turned out delicious!! Add this to dry mixture, and stir until they are fully mixed together. Thanks, April. Thanks so much! I have now also made Gluten-Free Graham Crackers, for all your dessert needs. Thanks for sharing, Kalyn; I was wondering if I could sub chia seeds for the flax seeds. I had them with a non dairy cream of asperagus soup. Hi Amy, ground chia seeds or psyllium husk might work! But with toppings theyre going to be great. Thanks! As for using oat flour:  Bobs Red Mill has gluten free oat flour, but even that creates problems for me so I dont use oats at all. That was the perfect snacking cracker. Please dont eliminate oil from your cooking because you have been mislead to think it is bad for you. They were easy to remove from the sheets afterward. I made these crackers but omitted the flaxseed meal (didnt have any) and put in chia seeds instead. They could use a bit more salt than is called for. Thanks for a great recipe. I also kept having to extend the bake time by 5 mins several times Great flavor though. If that doesnt bother you, then go for it! I used no additional water and four TBSP of oil. Even like this, they came out just fine. Thanks for the awesome recipe! Hi Mayen, pecan meal might work, but you will probably need less oil. I also am a big fan of salt so I sprinkled then gently pressed in flaked salt and I definitely dont regret it ;), Woohoo! I love a recipe that will let my creativity go wild. Oats are gluten free. Could you give me the conversion to English meas, in grams if poss? The taste of these crackers are amazing. What would be a good substitute? Alpha-linolenic acid, the particular amino acid that flaxseed has plenty of, is important for your heart health since it helps prevent clogged arteries and high cholesterol. Added a little nutritional yeast. Place a layer of plastic wrap or parchment paper on a clean countertop, then place the dough on top. You may need to adjust the amount of water and/or flour. Hope that helps! Were so glad you enjoyed them the second time around. This recipe was awesome. Not wanting to continue to pay $4.00 for my favorite G/F, vegan crackers, I decided to try this recipe. If the dough is too wet, they come out soft. Will also try with a good dose of pepper next time I think. I ended up using 5 tablespoons of ice cold water yet my crackers were extremely dry and bland. This will help them firm up and become easier to transfer to the baking sheet. Izzy | Pinch of delight, I love the idea of using the leftover pulp from nut milk because I always feel so wasteful for just tossing. Then adding it in place of the almond meal. Decided not to use the food processor, and used Bobs Red Mill 1:1 GF flour (the non-chickpea kind), almond flour, and safflower oil. I made these crackers and the banana muffins today and both are winners. Ours or store-bought? We have rosemary growing in the kitchen window. I have made these 4 times now and am still trying to get it right. Sign me up. I dont use oil ( at all ) what will happen if I leave the oil ( fat ) out ? Could the flour blend be subbed out for more almond flour for diabetic folks? Hi there, Im Dev, Chief Editor here on Healthier Steps, a Jersey girl now residing in Florida, and a first-generation Jamaican immigrant. I dont know why I waited so long to make it. Hi Bridget! I used the leftover almond meal from making the yummy almond milk and mixed almond flour and flaxseed meal instead of the flour mix listed. I appreciate how specific the directions were and I needed 5 tablespoons of water to get the correct consistency. Were so glad you both enjoy them, Susan! Just had my second go at making these crackers, and Im so glad I tried it again! Tag @minimalistbaker on Instagram and hashtag it #minimalistbaker so we can see all the deliciousness! And did you find the dough to be easy to work with or crumbly? Love how this recipe is so versatile. Can I put in a plea for grams and ml please? April. I made themadded 2 tbsp of nutritional yeast and 1/2 tsp garlic (I didnt see garlic on the ingredients list) and I didnt freeze and they were superb! Hi Dev, Could you roll out between 2 pieces of parchment and then bake them on the parchment? You have homemade crackers on your hands! Absolutely delicious! Thank you! I made these because I want to avoid gluten and processed fats from store bought crackers. Let us know if you do some experimenting! THANKS!!

I simply scored them, and after about 15-20 minutes rescored them to separate them. Instead of almond meal I used ground steel cut oats (homemade oat flour). I like using unbalanced almond flour also, and Trader Joes is wonderful. When I use almond flour or almond meal and flaxseed meal or psyllium husk powder, the carb per serving (and for servings that represent an actual meal) is in the 5 carbs. We are glad you enjoyed the recipe :D. Great recipe! Right now they are turning into cookie like and break very easily. Did it work? If I could, I would show you a picture of the ones I made last night. Or at least a conversion table. What herbs would you recommend to replace the rosemary? These ground flaxseed crackers are perfect to add to your diet because the flaxseeds are full of health benefits. YUMMY! Crackers from the store are soooo expensive and sometimes the oils are rancid. Thanks. I will adapt it to my own. They taste delicious and have a nice texture. (Wish I could attach a photo) The directions are followed exactly. This had good flavor and texture; I put probably twice the rosemary and garlic in. What do you consider Gluten free flour blend? It was my first time making savoury biscuits so I was a little worried but this recipe was perfect (and super easy!). Love the flavor of these crackers and found the recipe doable but my only wish is that they were more crispy! That kind of gave them an interesting crunch.

If you give it a try, report back on how it goes! * 1 teaspoon white pepper Wow! I am concerned about grinding it so fine that it becomes mushy, because my rosemary is fresh and not dry like most of the store-bought variety. I also increased the amount of garlic powder and used onion powder in place of the rosemary. But how to make crispier as opposed to crumbly? Store them in an airtight container for about 3 days. As a raw vegan Im always looking for simple ways to create versions of my old time food faves in a healthy way or make twists to create vegan version for my hubby to enjoy and devour. I didnt put them in the freezer first, just baked them. Okay, I dont subscribe to stuff. Thanks for sharing your experience, Nicole. Stop!
