I find the color works better on the cheeks, but it is fussy to put on (or fussy for me, anyways). Free of synthetic chemicals, artificial fragrances, colors and chemical preservatives. Report as inappropriate, by EricaC123 You just need time and patience to apply it correctly.  Made in a base of cocoa and shea butter to soften and moisturize skin and lips. Ive only tried a few 100% Pure products so far  these lip and cheek tints, the Organic Cucumber Face Wash Foam (which is really, really gentle), and the caffeine mask. Free of synthetic chemicals, artificial fragrances, colors and chemical preservatives. Sad it wasn't rated here, but I'm excited to try some of the others. Your email address will not be published. As a lip tint, I find I can only wear a thin layer if I want to keep the look natural and not messy, which means I have to apply the product often. But once I tried dabbing the tint rather than rubbing it into my skin, the results were much better. Report as inappropriate.
