It is very nice, but only if you want that look, Simon, kindly advise me what do you think about De Petrillo ready to wear range? Not too crazy or over-expressive choices, just not as practical as it could have been.

But it is very elegant, especially with a little of that textural pattern going on, like a herringbone. I have a question for you. Ive always thought that it is a classic, English patten for an office suit. I would recommend a navy for most, but some might prefer a charcoal or darker gray, either because of their personal colour palette or a stylistic preference for monochromes.

The song playing in Harvey's office that is a saxophone and he says it's his father playing. I, no doubt like all of your regular readers, find the Capsule Collection series of articles extremely helpful, not least because they outline a sensible and logical approach to wardrobe building with principles that can be applied across all budgets. Given all this, would it more make sense to combine the two lists (jackets and suits) into a more general list of commissions for those that work in tie-less/suit-less offices? Prologue might top a first commission as Im attracted by the cut and possibly will get more bang for my buck. I think youre on the right track. I think thats probably what Ill do. Thanks very much, Oh good, Im pleased that Guide was helpful Jamie. Surely it depends on the season? In other words, its done on purpose. Get another navy suit, just with a different texture (NOT a different, bright blue  theres nothing professional about that colour). The suit would be a navy suit and I am not sure whether or not the benefit of having two navy trousers would be beneficial as I am starting my wardrobe from scratch. If youre starting from scratch, and the suit would therefore get regular wear (say every two weeks at the least) then yes I would get two pairs of trousers. I would certainly generally advise against using a jacket from a suit separately  it works in very few cases. But I cant say much more than that Im afraid. Would that qualify as your mid-grey mentioned as a possibility for suit two? In addition to completing the business suit, it neatens the shirt by hiding the placket, perfecting the collar, and lengthening the torso, especially if you are carrying some extra Covid pounds.

[For more on picking the style aspects of a suit, read The Guide to Suit Style]. And a DB is now rather rare.  tobacco-ish linen / wool blend (not for any formal event). In which case, its actually working from the ground up, rather than the head down, which is a little counter-intuitive. Your advice, as always, is greatly appreciated, Simon. Ive already make some very effective changes to my everyday style and think Ill be ordering one of your oxford shirts soon. When I do wear something with a bit more personality, whether social or business, I do find it tends to put more of a spring in the step and just be a more joyful experience. I think very dark brown can be OK as well  see my Michael Browne coat outfit. The further experiments, if there are any, should be reserved for maybe suits 7 or 8. However, a (black or charcoal) suit is always hanging in the office, just in case something unexpected pops up. When I started with bespoke tailoring back in 2013 I stressed at the beginning on buying bespoke odd jackets and bespoke suits and neglected the trousers completely and also neglected the shoes as I had decent RTW shoes from Crockett and Jones and Alden. I had, but obviously not carefully enough. I dont think slanted pockets are that extraordinary. Would you choose 11 oz as you recommended for London? I myself already have a navy suit, and is experiencing this dilemma. Simon would you go with Fox Air fabric for a suit! (0:40); Jessica and Harvey listen to music while drinking scotch in his office. Hi Simon! Or midnight blue if you prefer, but nothing wrong with black either. Id suggest at least trying one grey in a list like this. The suit should be single breasted, have a notch lapel, two or three buttons on the front, and nothing else gimmicky like coloured buttonholes or flashy lining. Now, as I upgrade my wardrobe to bespoke from MTM, I am considering a change in philosophy. I am on the right track? Any personal advice for the reader to pick their first business suit? The heavier fabric will help in acchieving striking look, will help it survive longer and you can wear it most of the year (cool summer evenings + anytime during spring, autumn, and winter). However, Id like to get a MTM suit soon, and am now considering a mid-grey. If it is marginal one should always choose the higher weight. Ive always had great fits on every bespoke commission. I hail from Hong Kong, a place full of people passionate about the permanent style of menswear, but also of people who seem to put on whatever tee and sweatpants they have without any thought. The first two suits I have more or less have these qualities. Anyway, one of the largest focuses for my own wardrobe building is to own as few items as possible. Thats very disappointing to hear, but not unexpected. as well as bespoke casual shirts (imminent appointment with Luca A) as well as outerwear such as blousons, overcoats etc. However, I do wear my linen and corduroy suits quite often, either as one piece or just the jackets. Thanks Simon re. Theres a post on my sports jackets thats a good starting point  part of the Guide here. Dear Simon, A friend told me that a subtle texture like sharkskin or birdseye (small, mini) adds visual depth and sometimes a lustrous shine to a suit. In other words, is a ticket pocket actually informal, or is this something that I will obsess over, but 98 percent of the rest of the world will never notice? Simon argues against blue but it comes in so many shades other than navy to be a view a little narrow : cadet, French, light navy, dark navy, midnight, IKB, cerulean, yale, grey-blue, glacier, air-force blue etc. ";s:7:"keyword";s:22:"dusty blue suits scene";s:5:"links";s:1195:"<a href="https://meilleurholidays.iudyog.com/pkm/hair-lockets-for-mourning">Hair Lockets For Mourning</a>,
