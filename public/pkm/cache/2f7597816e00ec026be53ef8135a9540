Average out the 9 for performance and a 7 for value and the overall value would be 8. This comprises extra carbon strips moulded into the frame in a grid pattern both in the head tube and around the bottom bracket.         Terms of Service apply. As well as the widening of the head tube and the fork steerer that the 1 1/2in lower headset bearing allows, Bianchi use their X-Tex technology to provide more rigidity. Think your definition of 'cool' needs looking at Good because I've done my back in,big time (again). We need to find out what the opinion of the big groupset players is for discs of different levels, Lecchi said. Though the new disc frame is the big story, both versions of the Oltre receive a big makeover for 2014. This is an all-out performance bike designed for riding fast. Using technologies straight from F1 car design and aeronautics Bianchi combined advanced analysis to achieve a significant aerodynamic saving of 20 watts over the already hugely efficient XR2 frameset.

I have the impression that they (UCI) want to  when all the key groupset players are ready and equal, at the same level, maybe they will be more open, Lecchi said. That the vast majority of its customers will never enter a UCI sanctioned race has not gone unnoticed by the Italian brand, either. The fork crown integrates with the downtube and has legs that bow out to reduce air turbulence. If you have big ambitions and a loaded wallet, you should check it out seriously.". Complete with a mechanical, mid-compact Ultegra R8000 groupset, this bike will still go above and beyond the demands of the serious amateur racer. Thanks!

Terms and conditions of use. As a 'Reparto Corse' Bianchi dealer, we have our own in-store Oltre XR1 demo fleet available for fully supported demo rides; the geometry is the same for both, the ride of the XR1 is slightly more forgiving, the XR2 is all about speed, the XR1 about a balance of speed and comfort. The new 24mm wide C50 wheelset and 25mm Vittoria tubulars are definitely instrumental in the bikes cultured feel, keeping it zinging on the flat, gripping beautifully, and dispensing with false flats as if they werent there.

The Oltre series and Specialissima (along with the Infinito CV and Aquila CV) feature Bianchi's patented vibration dampening technology, Countervail. In addition to entirely new models, 2018 sees lighter weights, geometry improvements and a focus on optimising aerodynamics for its returning models. The new Methanol 27 SL gets 27.5 wheels, a tapered head tube, 12x142mm Thru Axle, chain stay mounted discs, a PF30 bottom bracket, internal cable routing compatible with electronic groups (hint, hint), an E-Type front derailleur mount, and a weight below 1,200 grams. In addition to its upcoming Infinito CV Disc endurance frame, which was announced shortly before Paris-Roubaix, the company will offer its redesigned thoroughbred racer, the Oltre XR2, with disc brakes for 2014.

On the mountain bike side, Bianchi has jumped wholesale into the 27.5 camp, adding both a hardtail and full suspension bike with the middle wheel size. Further down the line, Bianchi says it is looking into dropping disc options into lower price points. The new Zipp-challenging Dura-Ace rims are much better in crosswinds than earlier models. Developed in partnership with NASA, Countervail is a viscoelastic carbon material with a unique fibre architecture that Bianchi claims cancels up to 80% of vibrations while providing an increase to both stiffness and strength. It's a neat little touch. Bianchi have gone with a BB386EVO bottom bracket standard this time, although our review bike came with a Shimano Dura-Ace chainset plugged in there, with a 24mm-diameter axle. Anything's a sex toy if you're pervy or brave enough, Excellent bike with the performance and looks of carbon but the stunning comfort and longevity of titanium, Blurring the edges between race and endurance geometry-wise, but a decent build for the money.
