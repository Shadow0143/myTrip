Montpelier, VT 05620-3702 However, safety is always a concern when using electrified equipment. If you have old carpet, cut it into strips and lay it underneath the wire to ensure that the grass does not grow in those areas. x[mon&gJ8}wApi]E$ygf?6?Y~W_W?wlUnCYm/.W'0F2==aA@:(X~:=m,zz#vVai;4*8HyY%A{D	.==92&@T8=`{zD&(4U7UKU0IcBh*E4')phO/m-/hW?"gIx0qh)AF/uu(g=xBhrPWK+n3"xr[Wr>,Z{u%. Preventing bears from accessing your resources might even save that bears life, as food-conditioned bears often get hit by cars or shot if they create substantial damage or become a threat. Your most important maintenance tool is an electric fence voltage meter, sometimes called a fence tester. It was super simple to install and hasnt gotten in the way of my beekeeping whatsoever. I think the idea of working with electricity is frightening to most people.           Energizer manufacturing companies rate their products with an energy measurement unit called a joule.  Make your electrified fence as visible as possible. Electric fencing is a great way to protect beehives, chicken coops, livestock, and compost from bears. One hot wire is directly connected to the energizers positive terminal, and all remaining hot wires are connected to each other in a series. Proper design, construction, and maintenance will ultimately determine the effectiveness of your electrified fence. No matter which style you choose, a permanent electrified fence is most effective when designed with 12- or 14-gauge wire.

All rights reserved. We dont see the most complaints in areas with the most bears, we see most complaints in areas where we have the most people, Timmins said. A minimum of five wires is recommended, with the top and bottom lines hot. To extend battery life, some DC energizers have a very slow per-minute pulse rate, so be certain to purchase one that pulses at the recommended 45 to 60 pulses per minute. We value bears. Only low impedance energizers are recommended for deterring bears. tag_id.innerHTML = '<a onclick="showPrint(\'https://www.concordmonitor.com/getattachment/a2431320-af22-4e62-a077-a04613f73ed7/bearchicken-cm-070522-ph01\');" class="mycapturelink">  Buy this Image</a>'; These fences were designed to create small, moveable grazing pastures for small livestock, such as chickens, sheep, and goats while keeping them safe from predators.           Ballantine Communications, Inc. For beginners, purchase a starter kit. Visit www.bearsmartdurango.org or follow on Facebook. 3). One ground wire is directly connected to the energizers negative terminal, and all remaining ground wires are connected to each other in a series. Bear pulled chicken wire off outside of chicken run and ate chicken food.  Do not attempt to step over or climb through a fence that is electrified. The batteries that power DC energizers must be regularly recharged for your fence to remain at optimal performance; therefore, DC energizers will require more regular maintenance than AC energizers. . A properly constructed electrified fence is safe for people, livestock, and pets and has proven effective at deterring bears from human-related resources such as beehives, garbage, or small livestock. When possible, use crimp sleeves, brass ferrules, or other splicers to make connections.

Best protection from bears and other predators because there are smaller gaps than in a rope, tape or wire fence. They are commonly premanufactured in 25- to 164-foot lengths and can be connected in series to create longer or shorter fences. Solar: Solar energizers consist of a solar panel directly attached to both a rechargeable battery and a DC energizer, often sold as a single unit with battery and energizer enclosed in a case or housing. Note that energizers with 0.5 to 0.7 output joules will be advertised as energizing many more miles of fence than you may need; however, the higher output is required to be effective on bears. You could electrify a metal bird feeder, a door, or even harvested game using these basic electrified fencing concepts. var currentLocation = window.location; var photocredit = photocredit.toUpperCase();  Without adequate grounding, an electrified fence will be unable to deliver an appropriate shock to an animal. However, you cannot create too much grounding in your fencing design.

Some styles of AC energizers have on/off switches while others have to be directly unplugged to be turned off. Their standard pulse rate is 50 to 60 pulses per minute, receive consistent power and require less maintenance than DC-battery or solar units. 4 0 obj For some, very small, fence designs that cover short distances, 16-gauge wire could be considered. Even though touching an electrified fence is unpleasant, modern energizers are safe and should not produce injury. Inadequate grounding is the most common problem with electric fence performance and can be especially difficult to overcome in dry areas with rocky or sandy soils.  Id rather see people invest their money and time into electric fencing..  Email Us. The wire panel or net-wire fence would be directly attached to the positive terminal of the energizer (Fig. Because they are raised above the soil and attached to fiberglass posts, the panels would be insulated and remain fully electrified, similar to an all-hot wire fence design. It is amperage, not voltage, that determines how powerful a shock will feel. Large acreage fences will need higher joule rated energizers to provide optimal power to the entire fence. To connect energizers to fences, multiple strands of fencing wire in a series, or to connect multiple sections of fencing together, use insulated wire of 10- to 14-gauge specifically designed for electrified fences (Fig. These long duration, continuous current pulses can create a spark that can produce enough heat to set fire to vegetation. }. I notice quite a few new people looking (at electric fencing). 2). *tip: Look for an energizer that offers a minimum of 0.7 joules to effectively shock a bear. 6). Voltage readers only tell you if electrical current is passing through a wire. 2), 3) Is a combination of electrified wires on the outside of an existing fence (Fig. Dry or rocky soils do not conduct electricity well which reduces the amount of energy that will reach back to a single grounding rod and the effectiveness of your electrified fence. See the section discussing Energizers for more information. Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostics Laboratory, Texas A&M College of Agrculture and Life Sciences, Electrified fences rely upon moisture in the soil to conduct electricity that will deliver an effective electric shock. if (photocredit.indexOf(sellablestring) > -1) { Why does he value better wiring above better walls? Dealing with bear complaints often means killing the bear, because once they get used to raiding a particular location they can become dangerous. New Hampshire Fish and Game lends out electric fences to people with bear problems. It gets used year after year, day after day over summer months. Copper grounding rods may be used, but you should also use copper grounding wire and clamps to avoid electrolysis that can corrode connections. Modern low impedance energizers have been designed to transfer energy fast enough that a spark generated along the electrical path should not produce enough heat to start a fire.          With the backyard chicken boom showing no sign of abating, Andrew Timmins would like to give newcomers a bit of constructiveadvice. Polywire consists of many strands of wire braided within a polyethylene rope. //LBtag_id.innerHTML = '<a onclick="showPrint(\'https://www.concordmonitor.com/getattachment/b91e7104-1653-4fcb-8585-8359310da5a6/bearchicken-cm-070522-ph02\');" class="mycapturelink">  Buy this Image</a>'; Energizers come in a wide variety of makes and models, but all of them are designed to store energy and deliver it in short pulses through the connected wires. The higher the joule rating of an energizer means that it has a higher amperage. Support the Solar charged batteries are more expensive but use sunlight to charge themselves. The joule rating of energizers typically has one of two classifications: stored or output. Biologists caught two of the cubs and sent them to a rehabilition centerbut couldnt catch the third, which isnt old enough to survive in the wild on its own. var currentheadline = document.getElementById("headline").innerText;   Kits range from $300-500 and can be found at some of the following locations:(these are just some suggestions and are not listed in any particular order), Kits will come with instructions on how to install, but otherwise you can use online tutorials, We saw evidence of a bear trying to get into our coopthere were claw marks on the roof and it appeared it had been trying to pull the roof off, but then nothing else. For adequate grounding, all electrified fences will need a minimum of 3 to 6 feet of grounding rod per joule of stored energy from your energizer. If a gate is the only non-electrified portion of a fence, a bear is likely to discover it and use that spot to gain access to whatever is behind the fence. AC energizers are the least costly type of energizer to purchase and operate. There are three basic models of energizers to choose from: 110-volt AC: These plug-in style energizers connect directly to a 110-volt outlet (standard household current). Alternatively, hog or cattle panels can be used to create small enclosures with several lines of electrified wires attached to the outside. //var LBtag_id = document.getElementById('buylinkLBbearchicken-cm-070522,ph02'); Make sure that your ground rods are as far as possible from utility connections and water pipes.           endobj When a bear touches one of the hotlines and the grounded net-wire together, they will receive a full electric shock that does not require the energy to travel through the soil to complete the circuit (Fig. Without adequate grounding, an electrified fence will be unable to deliver an appropriate shock to an animal. Fiberglass or plastic posts can have the fencing wrapped directly around them. For excluding bears, the ground-return (pos/neg) design is recommended. For the typical backyard chicken coop, I would estimate you could electrify that for around $300. For small areas, such as chicken coops or two to three fruit trees, you typically will need an energizer with a joule rating between 0.7 and 1.0.
