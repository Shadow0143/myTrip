These steps are now unnecessary with current pump technology that applies proper pump sizing and speed along with vacuum control valves to produce predictable results. Look at Mcmaster carr for stuff. External crankcase vacuum pumps will provide significant power gains on both racing and high-performance street engines, primarily by promoting superior ring sealing. Vacuum may draw oil out from between the bearings and journals like a straw; thus, flow increases and the system pressure drops. With this hybrid pcv/electric evac setup, there is no need to worry about over-heating the electric vac pump, as it's only used for a few seconds at a time when the nitrous comes on. If you are trying to learn more about a crankcase evacuation system for an SBC, BBC, SBF, BBF, SBM, BBM, or other engines, we can help you along the way. Within this narrow range, builders can employ lower tension rings to reduce friction without fear of losing effective ring seal. The higher speeds also became a "catch 22" scenario since the additional power required to operate the pumps this fast was negating any additional Horsepower gains from the additional vacuum. It also introduces harmful contaminants to the lubrication system and poisons the incoming mixture in the combustion chamber. I also attached an exhaust hose to route the fumes outside the passenger compartment, under the car. When the pull ended at 6250rpm, even without the electric pump running the crankcase still had 3.9"Hg of vacuum left. So cool evac fumes with no oil vapor getting to the pump was key. The floating vane remains in constant contact with the bore of the housing so regardless of expansion due to heat, clearances and performance are not affected. We provide you with the exact weight, dimensions and performance of our products. That being said; the benefits of crankcase pressure evacuation are particularly effective on larger displacement engines or those with power adders that generate higher cylinder pressure and more blow-by. These smog pumps were being used for the complete opposite purpose for which they were originally intended (to generate negative pressure as opposed to positive pressure). Here's a list of vacuum drawn at various voltages The pump can also be found in wrecking yards, as Ford used it on various models as a smog pump, but they also used it on Mustang Cobra R's as a crankcase evac pump for the supercharged engines. Moroso regulator (PN 22633), top left) screws directly into the vacuum pump instead of a valve cover to prevent pulling excess oil out of the crankcase. What they have failed to mention is that this flow number is NOT on the suction side of the pump. With a pump mounted inside the car, the pump cannot be heard when the engine is running. That makes vacuum pumps one of the best bang-for-the-buck products available for both high performance and racing applications. That is an awesome number. Nitrous system was NOT turned on, electric pump was NOT turned on, this pull was NA. 4"Hg @ 12v (draws 12amps @12v) The pumps were also never designed to be connected to a crankcase on the intake side. Man it would be nice if somebody made a electric vacuum pump that would pull a decent vacuum on a small block. The size and speed of the evacuation pump, along with the size of the vacuum line, control the amount of vacuum. The hoses are -12 lightweight pushloc (3/4" id), and fit the electric pump's ports perfectly. If I buy a part or parts from you do not send me those parts through USPS, I would actualy like to get the parts I purchase. With eight distinctly different mechanical pumps and two electric pumps, STAR Machine has an ideal vacuum solution for any racing application. There are benefits to buying a crankcase evacuation system. GZ Motorsports offers an extensive range of all inclusive kits that are sized and equipped for specific applications. This is the most comprehensive vacuum pump warranty policy in the industry. Compared to today's aftermarket vacuum pumps which are designed specifically to produce vacuum in an engine crankcase, OEM Smog Pumps operate at a significant performance disadvantage. The pull started out with 12.6"Hg @ 2600rpm. This reduces oil leaks and increases horsepower from reducing build-up crankcase pressure. Dry-sump scavenge stages often do not pull adequate vacuum and the gerotor design tends to have a lot of parasitic drag, says Zucco. Since i'm only using the electric vac pump for short bursts of WOT, i could easily power it with a 16v or 18v cordless tool battery pack if i wanted to, but I have not seen a need to do that even when spraying a 250 shot. Many engine builders monitor crankcase vacuum throughout the engines power range. One guy claimed it mellowed out his engine that had a borderline too large duration cam for the street. Its an engine-performance trick practiced since the late 60s, first with passive crankcase evacuation methods or so-called Pan-Evac systems. Would this even come close to that kind of performance ? Pump manufacturers like GZ Motorsports and Moroso have each addressed this in their own way so the end consumer can make a thoughtful choice based on his needs and interpretation of their individual pump features. freq may vary. A1-Cardone 32-3500M This action relieves blow-by pressure under the rings, reducing windage and contamination. Note for those with BOOST that may be concerned about possible check valve failurethe pcv valve acts as a check valve if the flow direction is reversed, so an in-line check valve failure under boost conditions would make the pcv valve revert to it's highest restriction mode. No longer do you have to settle for a compromise when choosing a vacuum pump. Basically by adding that adjustment screw, I basically turned the pcv valve into an adjustable orifice without disabling it's reverse flow check-valve feature With low tension (gapless top) rings in the engine, 4 spd manual, 3.73 gears, and no overdrive, the Shop Mule spins about 3000rpm down the freeway. In spite of spinning 3000rpm down the freeway, the car still gets around 20mpg. Most of the noise that the pumps emit comes from their exhaust port, which sounds much like a vacuum cleaner. We promise not to use your email address for anything but exclusive updates from the Power Automedia Network. Here are some answers to frequently asked questions about crankcase evacuation systems: A crankcase evac kit helps the engine to release pressure built up in higher horsepower applications. You DO NOT have to use our intake/exhaust tank to be covered by this policy. This pressure is readable with a vacuum gauge. Due to their design, smog pumps also have very poor maximum potential vacuum numbers. Vacuum in the system increases the oil volume that the engine flows based on the reduction in resistance the oil pump sees on the pressure side. These gains are on par with and sometimes exceed those provided by a cam or intake manifold changes and pump systems are much easier to install. The crankcase evacuation system installation is then complete. The valve covers are circle track units that come with welded fittings for crossover breathers. We look at every pump application on an individual basis to ensure you get the correct pump for your application. Manufacturers offer a variety of pump sizes to accommodate large and small engines and various horsepower ratings. Those not familiar with history are destined to repeat it. Another consideration is the smog pumps adverse sensitivity to heat. Application (for the pump) was 01' LS Camaro/Firebird and I bought the pump from NAPA for $70. Strategic profiling results in more surface area for better heat dissipation. They can be mounted in any position. Delco 215-425 thanks for the info. JEGS offers a wide selection of crankcase evacuation systems from top manufacturers such as Mishimoto, Vibrant Performance, Jaz Products, JEGS, and more. Pump speed is adjusted by sizing the pulleys. External vacuum pumps are the ideal choice for hot street engines, bracket racing engines and other performance applications such as off-road racing or drag boats. Most dry-sump storage tanks also incorporate an integral breather tank, so a remote unit is often unnecessary. In effect, a dry-sump pump is also an external vacuum pump. More current national records have been set in NHRA, IHRA and PDRA using STAR Machine, 8 straight IHRA Pro Stock National Championships won using our. Smog pumps were conceived in the 1960's by the auto manufacturers to help reduce exhaust emissions. However, if your pump purchase also included our tank and was included as part of the original installation, the vacuum pump warranty is further expanded to be "unconditional" during the first year.

Anyone who owns an air compressor is aware of this. 8"Hg @ 18v The object of the Smog Pump, and its subsequent design, was conceived to pump air, not to produce vacuum. We don't use vague terms such as "lighter than" or "more volume than". Call us we may be able to help. To put 100 CFM in perspective it would require a vacuum pump 3 times the chamber/physical size of our Mountain Motor Vacuum Pump. Power adders such as turbochargers, superchargers or nitrous oxide increase cylinder pressure and blow by and thus require larger pumps and bigger lines to accommodate increased airflow. Thank you! Come join the discussion about performance, production numbers, VIN decoders, modifications, troubleshooting, power adders, DIY tutorials, and more! When researching exhaust style systems, if your vehicle doesn't have mufflers, confirm it will be compatible. We are the first racing vacuum pump manufacturer to utilize a one-piece aluminum shaft/rotor combination. The whole thing with bracket only weighs about 8oz. It prevents excess pressure exiting the crankcase through the oil drain-back holes in the cylinder heads, which could prevent oil return flow, affect the oil level and create unwanted aeration in the oil supply. These steps included special reverse-lip crank seals and silicone sealing the valve covers, intake manifold and so on. Exiting exhaust gasses pull a vacuum on the tubes, thus drawing excess crankcase pressure from the sump and discharging it out the collector. The theory was simple: add oxygen to the exhaust gases by pumping air into them. It may include fuel, exhaust gasses, carbon and other contaminants. While engine valve cover breathers release pressure, crankcase evacuation systems add additional suction to help pull the pressure out faster and more efficiently by connecting to the header collectors through a hose and fitting. I couldn't figure out where to mount it, what you have done gives me an idea. They are advertising 100 CFM from one of their vacuum pumps. The hoses are then connected to both the intake side of the check valves and the valve cover breathers, with care not to let the hoses touch the hot exhaust and headers. Those little pumps work great, I hooked one up for my buddy on a '72 Camaro with a 540 in it. As the air gets hotter later in the season and racers lean the engines out, they see vacuum readings go up, especially at idle and on the two step.. Electrical parts excluded. Simply loosen the jamb nut and turn the head (CW) to increase or (CCW) decrease the vacuum set point. Initially the electric vac pump worked ok by itself, the purpose of adding a pcv valve to the system was to eliminate vacuum pump's constant 14amp draw on the car's electrical system.
