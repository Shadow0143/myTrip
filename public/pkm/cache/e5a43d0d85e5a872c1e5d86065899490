The Orca RS1 Openwater Sleeveless wetsuit is ideal for swimmers who are looking for thermal insulation and protection while still having great buoyancy and flexibility in the water. Fortunately, Ive done some open water swimming over the years, and I feel confident in sharing some tips that have worked for me-for athletes preparing for their upcoming races. And in the section below, well take you through the tips to consider when choosing the right triathlon wetsuit. The hydrodynamic flexible neoprene made from Yamamoto neoprene 39 is sturdy, and I dont think its as fragile as some other suits. If you plan to hit open water, youll need an option with more buoyancy. Next, extra panels offer a range of motion, especially under the arms. This budget pick is reliable, and in the NeoSport Wetsuit review below, Ill demonstrate why it ticks on all the boxes for the best triathlon wetsuit, and its the only wetsuit you need. I remember that I liked the S2 wetsuit. The suit allows for exceptional flexibility featuring a 4-way stretch design while the super composite skin (SCS) leg construction creates a hydrophobic barrier that lifts your lower body and optimizes body position, technique, and speed as you swim. It just provides a bit more in terms of performance, usability, and fabrics. A: The best triathlon wetsuits should fit snug. This was after trying several wetsuits at a local sports shop and could get none of them to fit my thunder thighs. Plus, I can now extend my swim up to 30-minutes. I couldnt believe the flexibility Zone3 Vanquish offered, especially around the shoulders. Its an upgrade to the Zone3 Venture, which I really thought was darn good. For temperatures under 50 (10C) youll, however, require a sealed and taped zipper design as this provides more insulation. A: Yes, provided youre comfortable with it. While still on the buoyancy, we were pleased by the performance of the elevation panels. Combined, you get more speed for less effort. However, extra buoyancy can cause setbacks in your performance. Im amazed at how well it works, and even when Im in the open water swimming, I feel just like Im swimming in a pool without a wetsuit. Yes, S2 was a great picking, but I knew I needed something that would offer more than a good fit and warmth for my first Half Iron Man competition.
