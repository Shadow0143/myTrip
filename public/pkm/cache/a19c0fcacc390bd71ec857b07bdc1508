Our network should be in the AWS Direct Connect location. You must create a virtual interface to begin using your Direct Connect connection. All connections in a LAG operate in Active/Active mode. References: The benefit to this is that the connection can be partitioned into multiple private and public virtual interfaces. If an organization wants to communicate with several VPC instances, it should utilize a single virtual interface per VPC. You can use an AWS Direct Connect gateway to connect your AWS Direct Connect connection over a private virtual interface to one or more VPCs in your account that are located in the same or different regions. Connectivity over the Internet may fluctuate, as you do not have full control over how data gets from start to finish. A private virtual interface enables access to your VPC. Once your connections state goes from requested to available, you can create a virtual interface. If you want to disable route propagation, you will need to do so manually.

Bear in mind that you can create multiple virtual interfaces on a single AWS connection. Reduces bandwidth costs  The cost gets reduced in both ways, i.e. The option that says:Launch a Direct Connect Gateway that connects two public virtual interfaces in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) Region to the on-premises network is incorrect because a Direct Connect gateway simply enables you to use your existing AWS Direct Connect connection to access VPCs in your account on two or more AWS Regions.
