The price of the petrol model (2.7 GX) starts at 17.18 lakh. 22.23 Lakh while the top model goes up to Rs. This was the fastest and easiest car purchase I have ever experienced. Very much impressed with the service and the variety of benefits offered. Mileage - I will upload a detailed post on this as I have enough data now. The car is available in multiple variants.
