Theyre workable, but not ideal  I stick to rock thats at least vertical or steeper when using the Ergos. just comparing the damage to my regular axes against the damage from justa couple of routes with the Quantum Tech's to the carbon wrap. One of only two mountaineering helmets that Im aware of in the uber-light, sub-200g category and the only one thats dual certified for both climbing and skiing. If youre around Calgary/Canmore, drop me a line  the loaner set is here to be tested and used! Part of that comes from the carbon-fiber shaft, but also unlike the Nomic, the Dark Machine doesn't come with pre-installed pick weights or a hammer (though Grivel offers a smattering of accessories you can attach). And assuming you're climbing with two tools, that's over half a pound less to carry on the approach. I hope this helps. Really more of a tether than a leash in my mind but updated all-the-same. Thoughts on that? I could see the shaft getting obliterated after couple of mixed routes. Again, outrageous price, but maybe all these axes can be found cheaper somewhere. I dont find it more awkward for the alpine than the nomic is. Monte uses the combination of his guiding experience and civil engineering background to critically analyze equipment and apparel providing in-depth reviews on exhaustively tested gear. Good luck with your quest for a replacement.Jeff. The new Dark Machine is a technical, ice climbing focused tool that weighs in at a measly 470g. For pure steep ice Id say X-Dream. Funny, everyone keeps saying the ErgoN is awkward on easy ice. Climber, photographer, Scotch aficionado. includes discounted products from Rockfax. MSRP will be $249.95 USD. Had to remove all the nubs so not to bruise my fingers. Not at all, I've just got a pair of aspeeds and don't want to use them because they are to nice! I haven't used them on any serious routes because I'm too scared of the damage that would occur. So, despite being a fan, Ithink it's time for a change. I know, youre thinking that Petzl wasnt at OR so why/how are they getting included. Editor in Chief at Black Sheep Adventure Sports. You have 100 days time to do that. Other than that, its all about the same with a 2kN load rating and single swivel. Petzl is updating the Dart and replacing the Dartwin with a single new crampon which theyre calling the Dart. I am fortunate in that Petzl sent me two pairs of these tools: one that I use as my personal tools for drytooling and mixed climbing, and a second pair that has been a dedicated loaner set. Albeit I think Camp/Cassin might have also upgraded their picks. Upon closer inspection it appears that the rubber covering is press-fit into small channels in the plastic grip, and I would imagine was also glued down to the griprest at some point. Parts can be a bit more faff to get hold of at short notice compared to the bigger players. Reactor is pretty much 1 on 1 copy of X-Dream. Lighter but slightly shorter than the Nomic and not as aggressive / crap on ice as the master alloys.Only downsides is the serious cash and difficulty of getting spare parts. I'll let you guess. we are not shipping to the uk at the moment. The Pur'Ice pick provides efficient placement in any type of ice.  2022 Outdoor Gear Exchange, Inc., All Rights Reserved. The Slinger, a single lanyard designed for piolets, received the same upgrade with a new carabiner and color change. Otherwise generally seems the BD tools are lagging behind Cassin/Petzl a little in terms of climbing ice. Just had a look at the Dark Machines. Yep. I meant Master Alloy in the post above. Weight, weigh distribution and how things work are a completely different thing. I was going to throw the eclimb Cryo 2 into the mix, but it looks like they're not making them anymore. I've found the X-dream picks are a bit of the soft side. There are currently no hard timelines attached with that second phase. I'm still not sure why Nomics have such a cult following with all the issues, but that's another story. My Nomics are still hanging in there, but I have my eye on the Dark Machines for my next axe. Eventually, as stock on the old picks disappears, the new modular system will also be made available with replacement picks. Feed back was phenomenal but Petzl decided differently. Grivel is testing Dark machines for three years now and God knows what they experimented during this time. Signup for our newsletter to get notified about sales and new products. Two weeks ago, I ran across a guy that was using a prototype of Grivel Dark machine X. Nomic like swing, toyish weight and super comfortable handle coated with rubber stuff like on all other dry tooling tools from Grivel. Some glue will take care of the loose rubber, but this is the kind of minor wear and tear I was not expecting to see on tools that cost almost $1000 Canadian for the pair ($480 Cad PER tool! Plus with it beingCNCd, its very durable and isnt susceptible to wobbly heads or flexing etc. / $360 USD). An eye is provided on one end for clipping to a harness. Featuring a minimalist hammer, the head is protected and allows the user to hammer a piton back in. Its an alloy tube wrapped in carbon, so it will be very durable. What are you doing with your 'broken wobbly' nomics? TheKailas Entheos II is probably the sexiest looking CNC milled axe out there. Nope Fusion 2 was never a copy of Nomic. The bd reactors are a bd copy of x dreams so I guess will be good also but I haven't seen them to compare. BD is changing how they fabricate their ice tool picks to improve durability. The Alpinist Tech will come with anti-balling plates and full automatic toe and heel bails. Utilizing composite technology that has until now been the realm of smaller, custom manufacturers Grivel has created a line of very lightweight tools with a fantastic balance and swing well as far as I could tell without any ice to actually swing into. X dreams, I really rate mine. There are more but the top list shows innovation. The color has also been changed from orange to green. BD doesn't do anything exciting any more. You must have JavaScript enabled in your browser to utilize the functionality of this website. Fusion 1, Nomic (all), Scud, Takoons (+new versions), Cryo, Force carbon, Aspeed, X-dream, Anchar2, anything by Austrialpine. When it comes to performance, these tools still astound me every single time I use them. (Though I suspect Grivels Dark Machine X will give the Ergo some solid competition when they finally show up.). I do know a few people that do use the ErgoN (or even the old Ergo) on easier and less-steep ice, but they are definitely the exception: most climbers I know favour them on steeper ice. The picks that will now be hot forged are: Grivels new Duetto helmet is similar in construction to Petzls original Sirocco in that its made entirely of EPP. UIAA page doesn't seem very real wold. Two things are certain, it will be outstanding tool and it will be super expensive. Factor in the lower price ($280 X-Dream vs $360 Ergo) and cheaper picks ($45 Cassin vs $65 Petzl) and its hard to justify the Ergo if youre not spending a lot of time drytooling with it. On Oliund you can return a product for any reason: it is not what you expected, the shoe size is wrong, the pants' color is not the one your like. I was looking at the BD Fuels or - the rather extreme option - some Grivel Master Alloys? Whatever you want to know about the Bozeman area's outdoor activities, lifestyle, wildlife, amenities, and culture it's all right here. A full carbon-fiber shaft keeps weight to a minimum, and textured handles help your gloves stick without over-gripping. Following WI 5 is the limit for me right now. That doesn't seem likely - if there were any chance of the shaft sustaining serious damage - ie, being ''obliterated" - then it wouldn't pass a safety test. And after some early incidents with the bottom pommels on the latest-generation Nomics also breaking (mostly through misuse, however), would the Ergonomic  designed, presumably, for much harsher use on technical ice and demanding mixed- and dry-tooling routes  show any weaknesses? I have the Quantum Tech and don't think they would stand up well. With the Dry pick on, the way these tools hold onto tiny rock edges is nothing short of astonishing, and this works in ice as well: a tiny ledge that most tools would pop off of is a solid hold for the Ergos. The main difference between those, is that you cant change the angle of the handle on Reactor. Had to read that twice, mistook rate for hate. Admittedly Grivel do sponsor him, but I'm sure he wouldn't trust his life to gear he thought was substandard! These new crampons are called the Alpinist Tech and of course expand upon the Alpinist line. Sign up to receive news about Oliund new arrivals, events and sales. I was looking at the BD Fuels or - the rather extreme option - some Grivel Master Alloys? > I mostly climb ice (up to W6), some mixed (M6/7?) It will come in 1 size (53-61) and two colors: blue or grey. Even on very low angle spots mid pitch before getting steeper, no problems whatsoever. 37 Church Street, Burlington, VT  Hello all,I've been a more or less proud owner of nomics (gen2) for the past 3 or 4 years and have now managed to break (bad case of wobbly head) my second nomic in this time. Looking to get started in a new outdoor sport? Quite comfortable to hang onto, its designed to be wrapped with a tape or bike tubing for grip as well as a customized feel. The first step will be the introduction of the new modular picks with newly sold tools. Fortunately, unlike the original Sirocco, the new Duetto doesnt look like a dick. No rush to replace this winter, see what next year or the sales bring. One of the benefits of Hot forging is that it doesnt leave residual stress in the steel which is subsequently tempered for durability and strength. So Fusion 2 is a copy of the Nomic - check. I may well be wrong and feel guilty as I climbed a lot with Takoons which were essentially the same axe. The shape of the bottom handle doesnt allow for a comfy grip when using the upper grip. Grivel is joining Petzl in the modular pick & pick accessory game with what theyre calling the Vario System. Articles, maps, gear reviews, events, photo galleries if it's outdoors and southwest Montana, it's in here. I am not a good ice climber, so I only climb easy ice. My Nomics sat around as I climbed almost exclusively on the Ergo. Reactor is done from scratch and in all essense X-Dream w/ BD pick placement & alpine hammer (and Id assume also adze for those that want something like that). I am surprised it is continuously marketed as for extreme grades only. I much prefer the X-dream handle as it feels more positive and it's nice to have a proper spike on the base of the handle to clip leashes. That sort of carbon shaftgenerally isnt a fan of impacts (or at least thats what I learnt in my studies  ) and I'd rather not snap my axe mid ice pillar a day after having climbed a mixed route! > just comparing the damage to my regular axes against the damage from justa couple of routes with the Quantum Tech's to the carbon wrap.
