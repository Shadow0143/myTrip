Opinions, please, on quartzite counter tops for my kitchen. this marble doesn't etch or stain. I don't want to strip off whatever they applied. This treatment system is designed to only remove the stainand assumes you already have your premium sealer to reseal the stone for resistance to future stains. great stuff. @Beth H. :can you clarify which you recommend for quartzite? For example, quartzite countertops need to be sealed because they have pores that can allow liquids to penetrate the stone and stain it. HYDRO BAN Sheet Membrane is a waterproof sheet membrane that is installed using a substrate appropriate LATICRETE thin-set. Why? so is the Tenax. The two 511's you have are good, but they might enhance your stone. STAIN-PROOF SMC Peroxide Additive, formerly known as SMC Boost, is a unique and powerful additive that enhances the stain removal, lifting, and cleaning power of STAIN-PROOF SMC Peroxide Cleaner.
