My first trainer  bought because of your review. But what about roadfeel. Note: Not compatible with 2021 Apple TV Edition. Now, I start to do some light climbing while increasing my power, and you can see theres a little bit more lag on some of the harder efforts. And yes, all done as described above on both days. I did like this trainer as it only simulated up to 6% on inclines which made going up to the Radio Tower on Watopia a lot more fun!  Accuracy level: +/- 5.0% And thats fine. It seems as though its in sim mode even when use erg mode is turned on. Our current toaster doesnt have wide enough berth for it. Watch my video here and read the description/comments link to youtube.com. It felt ok though the resistance on the flat was perhaps a little high, maybe related to pushing the roller in a bit further to ensure good contact. Once youve done that, youll finish attaching the bracket and Tuo slowly with a small pile of screws. As for trainer tire, I didnt  mostly because my past testing hasnt found trainer tires any more quiet. Its still a trainer, and Im still looking at a wall in front of me. Try poking and rattling a screwdriver in the gaps to see if you can dislodge it. Its a wheel-on trainer, thus, youre going to have the noise of the tire against the roller, and depending on how fast you go, thats gonna be pretty loud. 7) Youre done. You would need to swap the skewer over too, unless you have spare turbo skewers and leave them in place. My Tuo is very good and the response time to gradient changes is the best Ive ever had. Of course, Id prefer it be accurate. i have tried all sorts and the ERG mode fluctuations are driving me crazy. A firmware update fixed that (Last week). Which trainer would you choose, the Tacx or the Elite Tuo? At 260 watts, that was already 13 minutes into the ramp test, but it either still hadnt warmed up properly or it was just failing to change resistance. Will give it another go tomorrow. With the snap you feel like it takes a few seconds before the road feel kicks in, versus the Tuo almost feels like it naturally accelerates with you almost. The only change I make is adjusting the axle mount as the QRs are different widths as one bike has discs and the other V brakes takes literally 1 min to switch bikes. Just entering this discussion mid-way through, but when you did the warm-up calibration process, did you remember to re-do the wheel-on roller as part of that? Apple TV? Though, Im gonna cobble together an older small TV for the garage/shed and stick an Apple TV on it. Hi there, Not very good examples to encourage you to pay for the others. Then, I come here and write about my adventures. This is all in addition to the trainer itself. You can reset it all by going back into the configure setting, and following the steps there. I was able to calibrate Zwift using an iPhone with Bluetooth (thus, an iPad or even Apple TV would work the same). And to compliment that, heresThe Girls (my wifes) list. Whereas in TrainerRoad Im looking at its ability to hold a specific wattage very precisely, and to then change wattages instantly in a repeatable way. Im headed to Washington DC  what do you recommend for training? My last go I was a little annoyed and just did a sprint past the recommended 33.9 km/h and a window popped up and said to stop. My Photography Gear: The Cameras and Equipment I Use Daily, DC Rainmaker 2021 swim, bike, run, and general gear list, Copyright DC Rainmaker - Updated May 21st, 2022 @ 5:01 am, Wired or Wireless data transmission/control, Can electronically control resistance (i.e. Free riding and everything else  great. Im totally lost. The reviews generally take a lot of hours to put together, so its a fair bit of work (and labor of love). So I dont generally use it. But if I needed something to be accurate, the fact the work interval is nailed is good. I dig into the nuances of these both within the power accuracy section. I ordered and received a Tacx Neo 2T the other day. Having never used a trainer before, do you recommend going for the nicer wheel blocks and how much of an impact does it have on your ride experience? I travel a fair bit, both for work and for fun. Small ring up front, middle in the back to keep things neutral and as straight as possible. I'm one of the ones that do. Often times within 1%. i even use the power meter on my crank and it is not smooth, my old tacx flow smart may not have not been accurate, and sounded like a jet engine, but at least it would output a smooth graph in ERG mode, its a shame as the Tuo has a great road feel and is much more quiet. Also, especially dont be a dick when youre wrong. Ive added the Elite Tuo into the product comparison database. Bluetooth Smart FTMS (Trainer Control): This allows apps to control the Tuo over Bluetooth Smart (with cadence/power data). 9. Its just a bit slow. If they are reading high, then that just lets your avatar go up the hills faster . Essentially, if youve got a road bike, then youll configure it like the photos in this review. Likewise if I have to peddle at a certain cadence/power, in concentrate on the cadence and the power takes care of itself after a few seconds. So I enabled power matching. PC? (Note: All of the charts in these accuracy sections were created using the DCR Analyzer tool. If youre new around these parts, heres the long version of my story. Why. I like it a lot and am hoping more updates will come along soon. I have the latest firmware Am I doing something wrong? I had an Elite Tuo and it broke after 1 months use. Why havent you yet released a review for XYZ product you mentioned months ago? And its a mess. Thank you. So my guess was just something transient WiFi-wise. This allows you to compare it against other trainers Ive reviewed. Other people are recording the same thing. Finally, Elite does have their own app that you can use for a handful of functions, but frankly I had no use for it here at any point in the testing cycle. Bluetooth Smart Speed/Cadence Profile: This broadcasts your speed and cadence as a standard BLE combo Speed/Cadence sensor This was only in a couple of the community videos, as I thought the elite ones looked expensive  maybe they work better. I dont know if the movement knob feels tighter than it should or the unit doesnt move back as smoothly as it should which makes you feel like it cant get any further when it can or what. Its not completely clear from the comments, but Kevin described configuration, not calibration. With that  lets begin! I tried to use the search functionality, but was unsuccessful. And being awesome is what its all about! A Do you have additional sensors? window pops up. Its a pattern thats common in some trainers. Im guessing if I add a power meter to the crank and a cadence sensor to my indoor bike  Ill need one then as Ill run out of connections. What do you think about? I was getting all excited about the Neo from all the reviews, etc, and when it arrived, it needed a firmware update so did all that. This is the first toaster Elite has made, though, theyve made countless wheel-on trainers over the years. Anyone else has the same problem? Paired to Zwift before I had even realized it was pairing. Ray, Im currently using an Elite Rampa (older wheel on, Im happy thus no reason to change) and Im considering buying a PM for my future races. I kept going and unscrewed it so far that the nut came out of the bottom and the knob fell off! Plus, in the grand scheme of things, those frustrations only last a few minutesone time. The Apple TV remote sucks though. No impact to accuracy (as seen), or ride feel. After the last post I tried various routes in the elite app and it didnt feel right at allthe road in the video and the claimed inclined werent being reflected in the feel of the trainer. The calibration would just be some good peace of mind if I could get it to work properly. Will be the same with the snap. Well, its not quiet. What are you using? Ive attached a picture below showing what I mean. Far louder than most other trainers on the market today, because most other trainers arent wheel-on trainers. And finally, in the mean-max graph, we see a little bit of a dip as we approach the 30-second range, which makes sense, as thats in the territory where some of my slow-moving surges happen, and where we see latency in the Tuo. Guess Im doing only flat courses until Im getting a replacement or buy something differently. I had very strange issue with Tuo and found a solution, so maybe someone will use it in future. And none of it is technically hard. To install your bike youll open the side mounting handle, as well as flip the rear switch to the left, which moves the Tuo backwards away from the trainer frame. Plenty of reasons why some would want wheel on over direct drive. I dont think too much pressure on the roller will make it feel like theres more rolling resistance in Zwift. In the UK/EU/Australia/New Zealand? For example, here it is doing the spin-down within TrainerRoad on an iPad: Its super easy to do, you just pedal a bit fast for a moment until it reaches a given threshold speed, and then you stop pedaling. I saw a few dropouts, but on those days it was all devices in/near the bike. Aside from pumping up your tire, in my experience the rest of the steps only need to be done once a month or so. And, you can hit that play button below to dive straight into all sorts of toaster fun: Note that this Elite Tuo media loaner was sent over by Elite to try out. I had a bad experience on an older Elite Mag Crono on which the plastic rear part of the frame is completely skewed after some years of use. which is pretty slack, but your figures seem way off those tolerances. Definitely enjoying the road feel. This impacts inertia and how it feels  primarily when you accelerate or otherwise change acceleration (such as briefly coasting). I havent tried it yet to see how different it is but hope its not worse . As well soon discover, its not assembled out of the box, which is pretty common on less expensive trainers. Im from out of the country and will be visiting the US, whats the best triathlon shop in city XYZ? And in fact, Im able to double-verify that not only by manually forcing it off, but because the firmware version Im on wont broadcast cadence from the Tuo if PML is enabled.
