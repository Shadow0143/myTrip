I bought a Mitutoyo calliper 30 odd years ago and it is still an outstanding tool, I bought two in Lidl for an outrageous 8 and some pennies each and have got a freebie from someone with a rotary table, the best value one was from Machine DRO and has a large digit display and very smooth operation, checking against my Mitutoyo slip gauges it acquits itself very well, not bad for 26. They don't sell fake stuff. Think you will find that calliper manufacturers buy in their labels, make sense to let someone make thousands at a time, economies of scale equals bigger profits. #signup input ~ label.wrap { Click THIS LINK for full contact details.

In this instructable I will show you how to fix calipers that show a false value. My caliper never displayed correctly past 50mm, now working spot on the hole length!                                             Dandenong VIC 3175 Still works fine though, now it just looks a little "customised".                      2 years ago For any difficulty using this site with a screen reader or because of a disability, please contact us at 1-800-444-3353 or [emailprotected].
