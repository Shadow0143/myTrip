Status  	 The Casita deeply cares about the Madrigals and puts their safety before itself, going as far as getting everyone out when it was falling apart from the loss of the magic, and used the last of its strength to protect Mirabel from harm. Place the Mirabel doll on the staircase, and it transforms into a surprise slide that she glides down! 	 	 "Casita" translates to cottage or small house in Spanish. Kids can find all the fun details to spark imaginative play. The next day, Alma found Mirabel at the river where her husband Pedro died before the Casa Madrigal was created 50 years ago, admitting it was her fault in causing the house to lose its magic for the amount of pressure she put on her family and taking the miracle for granted. 	  rainforest.Decorate the Magical Casa Madrigal with 15 house accessories, including beds, tables, and chairs, and play out your favorite story scenes with the included Mirabel doll. Have a question about this product? Each bedroom door depicts its inhabitant using their respective gift carved into the wood, and they emit a golden glow that illuminates the image. Like the family that lives there, this home was blessed with magical gifts. I gifted this playset to my niece for her 7th birthday, and she absolutely loves it.
