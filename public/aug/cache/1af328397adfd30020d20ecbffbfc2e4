This helps with lightness and lift whilst still encouraging a contact (they still take you in). The curb action occurs when the horse is stretching out the neck prior to take off as obviously we are not going to "drop" the horse in the bottom of a fence and a contact is needed until one can give through the air. The Sprenger Sensogan KK Ultra 2 Ring Elevator Bit features a mouthpiece that is adapted to the anatomy of the horses mouth making it both mouth and tongue friendly.

The sweetiron mouthpiece is black and it is designed to oxidise - this is what tastes sweet and it is during oxidisation that a thin brown coating will appear on the outer surface and this will not wear off as our mouthpieces are solid. 16 mm diameter over the bars and tapering to 8 mm over the tongue. Everything remains more still in the mouth and if a horse is lacking in the confidence to stretch into the contact, this may prove extremely beneficial. The central lozenge gently stimulates the tongue promoting mouthing and salivation whilst the comfort factor deters overactivity which may lead to tongue evasions such as drawing the tongue back, getting the tongue over the bit, etc. Obviously when the bit is suspended in the mouth, the pressure is reduced across the floor of the mouth, tongue etc. The 45 degree angled middle link enables soft yet precise aids. This investigation resulted in groundbreaking knowledge about the space conditions and the position of bits in the horses mouth. This is over 2,000 years old and obviously since then significant advances have been made in design. It is not suitable for a Novice Rider or Horse that does not fully understand the aids. British Dressage have recently changed the rulings on when doubles are compulsory. It is prudent in the first instance to walk the horse in-hand, bringing him back to halt several times. This also means we can't apply any further discounts or promotions. It generally promotes mouthing and salivation. After they master  on the bit relaxed, ethnic and round they graduate to a simpler snaffle. Obviously the lower down the rein is employed the more emphasised the action is however, many people drive and ride "rough cheek" - this means that the rein is attached to the snaffle ring. When a contact is taken, pressure is exerted over the outer edges of the bars and the edges of the tongue are squeezed excessively. A bit with a similar action and much less potential for trouble is the loose ring loop snaffle. Usually sourced when a true, consistent contact has already been established Patented, unique bit exclusive to the Neue Schule Collection. The NS TranzForm generally gives much greater control without a fight or head toss during downward transitions. When a contact is taken the upper arm is angled forwards causing the mouthpiece to lift - thereby suspending it in the mouth and reducing the pressure across the tongue and the bars - this is often beneficial for cases of over sensitivity. Scientific research: The development of the KK ULTRA bits is based on the results of a measurement of mouth cavities of horses initiated by SPRENGER, carried out by the University of Veterinary Medicine in Hanover. Therefore the horse is much more comfortable, much much less likely to fight and head toss. This bit is perfect for my mare when she doesn't want to stay with the contact. Plenty of time should always be allowed for the doubles to be introduced in a very relaxed, low key manner so that there is no association between the doubles and more advanced work. Another ruling that I consider illogical is that some FEI/BD legal snaffles are not legal when used with a Weymouth - this includes the mullen mouthpiece and any snaffles with a revolving barrel and independent side action. With the French Link when a contact is taken the two little proud semi-circles joining the link are felt by the horse near the outer edges of the tongue and this is where they are most sensitive. The Universal is one of my personal favourites. It is very cleverly shaped to give tongue relief but be kind over the bars. The Australian Cheeker is often seen on racehorses. The play and mouthing is generally obtained by using it in conjunction with a loose ring bradoon. It is especially good for the sensitive mouth where the contact is inconsistent. Is anything interfering with the palate and have we given the tongue enough room? The difference with the Mors Lotte mouthpiece is it will not roll forward and exert too much pressure across the tongue. The cheeks are always attached to the small offset ring at the top - the top ring is angled very cleverly in order to avoid excessive cheek pressure.
