I have owned my X 10 follow for about 8 weeks and at first my friends were a bit envious of the new sporty looking trolly.However 2 months on and they now laugh at all the constant errors it makes.It will do an uncontrollable doughnut when no button is pressed, not a good thing to happen as your playing partner is about to take a shot.When directing the trolley to the next tee as I was on the previous hole putting green it failed to turn and also stop, eventually crashing to a halt into the course perimeter hedge, thankfully there wasn't a lake or river near as the trolly would have been lost.So far unfortunately my experience hasn't been good and I am now starting to regret purchasing this trolly, it's not the improvement I hoped it would be.

COVID-19 we are compliant with the SGU instructions for golf -. kind regards, I have written a review before but felt I have not given the Stewart trolley the achievement it deserves having read some of the reports earlier.The Q trolley is my fourth trolley I firstly had the X3 followed by the X5 which was  then followed by the X7 I purchased the X7 because Stewart threw in the lithium battery in all that time I vever had any problems with any of the aforementioned trolleys the only problem I had with the X7 was that I inadvertently let in go in the river which runs through our cousrse at Wilmslow.I sent it back to Stewart who then informed me that the electrical parts were so damaged they could not repair it but could fit the electrics for the X9 to which I agreed.The trolley was repaired and returned to me within the week.The service I received was second to none because I have dealt with Stewart for a good number of years having my trolley serviced I know several of the Staff namely Ann in Sales Jan and lately Debbie.In all this time I have never had any trouble with any of my Stewart trolleys.I  was quite happy with my last X7/9 trolley and so you would ask why buy the Q trolley?.Well the answer being now that I am approaching my 85th year I thought why not get the Stewart follow so thats why I purchased the Q.I have three Sons who all play golf so I don't have to tell you what happens next.One of my Son's obviously said "What are you going to do with your X7/9 Dad so being Dad I let one of my Sons have it together with the instuctions booklet and up to this date there has been no problem with that trolley either.My other problem now of course is being of that age the others are hakering after my Q trolley when anything happens to me.So Stewart being that I have had four of your trolleys without any problems of only the one of my fault I feel I am more than qualified to state the customer who is having problems with his trolley must be of his own making.I am Sir Yours Truly Michael Robins, Thank you for your heartfelt review Mike, it's fantastic to hear that you have been such a great supporter of Stewart Golf throughout the years and that you have loved not just one of our trolleys, but four!
