Do you have any advice on when to paint the cabinets? Hi! Was this your first time doing a carpentry project or a spray paint cabinetry project? We have a new home, with one walk-in closet assigned to each of us, husband and wife, and 1 each to the 3 kids, that Im trying to design economically, yet as tastefully as youve shown can be done. We didnt have the room to do so (and it being winter ruled out spraying outdoors), as well as knowing that we were going to be adding all the trimwork and wallpaper onto the units itself made painting it all in advance seem like wed be painting everything twice. Is it separating at all from the melamine? White was much better. Can you share what you did with the ceiling? In doing a little more research online, I discovered that many people have had the same problem with the intense and long-lasting chemical smell of this paint, *especially when they do two coats instead of one,* and theres essentially nothing to be done about it except to wait several months until offgassing is complete. Did you alter the depth of the drawer? document.getElementById( "ak_js_1" ).setAttribute( "value", ( new Date() ).getTime() ); This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Totally bummed now. Hope that helps! Thank you so much for sharing all this info, this is absolutely STUNNING and I cannot wait to see if my husband and I can figure out how to do this in our much smaller space. I have PAX lighting that Im using in another part of my house. I, too, did two coats, allowing a few days for offgassing and curing before the second coat, and keeping windows open and fans running during painting and afterwards. Lovely, lovely closet! We actually installed the drawer thats intended for the shallower 13 Pax unit into the 29 unit where the electrical box came in, which allowed us about 15 of room to play with for the electrical box. We painted the original IKEA hanging rod hardware to match the closet paint and then cut down basic wood hanging rods to fit each wardrobe. We made it into a little bench seat that looked like a custom upgrade. I just wondering how u did this fantastic ceiling? I will definitely prime it 1st, then paint it! SUPER helpful as I am in the process of planning my own Ikea hack wardrobe. We attached the baseboards to the front of the wardrobe units with construction adhesive, and added nails where the baseboards sat flush with the vertical sides of each individual wardrobe unit. Hi! To recess the lights, we used a router to trace a template we made in a scrap piece of wood. Netballer. This closet came in at under $3K if thats helpful info, I know that a California closets would have been 3x more at a minimum, so it was an easy choice for us, but we didnt hire a carpenter, so I dont know what it would have cost in labor. I wanted a paintable wallpaper so it looked seamless with the units and I also love the hint of added texture. Amazing job. But, it does seem like a TON of work for a DIYer, and that you would need a professional carpenter to help with all the details. If yes, how do we do it? I also wish that they offered smaller height and width, paneled, hinged doors, so if one wanted to cover just the top or bottom part of the wardrobe frame with the doors, it could be done. BEAUTIFUL work! Thank you! We had the same situation with a window in the center off the wall of closet. We set a routing depth equal to the thickness of the puck light, so it would be completely flush with the lower surface of the shelf. This is gorgeous. It really inspired me to have a built in closet in my small condo! Unfortunately, the room is 234cm tall, so no chance to get in a 236cm wardrobe without some major alterations. The room is 65 across and theres 37 between the units. We set up our laser level (weve named it our tool of the year since it has made our lives SO much easier) to keep our baseboards level. If we had higher ceilings we would have elevated the units on a wooden base to ensure that we werent losing any potential storage space when we added baseboards. Is this what you used for your project? Then we installed the shelf and ran the puck light through it on each unit. A great work you have done, and Im planning to do something similar.. but why such a bad color? Youre right, they are 24 not 29 units. Im no stranger to the concept of hacking IKEA products, though we actually had never done it ourselves. Because we knew we were going to have rattan boxes on a top shelf, we knew the cords would be invisible. Hi, I love what youve done! For this, we used some scrap strips of 1/8th inch tempered hardboard to bring the shelf up to level and secured it with screws. Because the top of the baseboard profile is flat horizontally, it allows the wood that we applied later on to the fronts of the cabinetry to flow seamlessly. On the sides, we added flat panels of wood to cover the gaps between the Pax units and the wall. Thank you for sharing. Did you take the drawer tracks out in order to paint? I told her I already had!. The pack i purchsased allows for you to connect  6 lights but how is that possible for the lights on the opposite side. Would you be able to give the dimensions of the walkway space between the two units? Hope that helps! Its the Rye from Hudson Valley Lighting! are), but Im not sure about the drawers. document.getElementById( "ak_js_1" ).setAttribute( "value", ( new Date() ).getTime() ); Mother. I filled the screw holes with plaster (twice) and the panel gaps with silicone sealant. I need an extension to one of my cords to reach the bridge connector. Now the closet looks super custom and you can see how all components came together in a space that feels much more high-end than a basic IKEA hack! This was something I was very concerned about because the shelves in the Pax units dont sit flush with the sides of the Pax units, so the depth of wood needed here was thicker than the 1/2 inch Poplar we used everywhere else. Hi! Its a good question! Unfortunately no the primer step is listed after the wallpaper. When you painted, how did you keep the paint from filling the holes that you wanted to leave open on the adjustable shelves? Firstly well done your room and the cabinets look incredible! Hi! Im at the trim stage now. 3 years later, we decided to sell that house. 1m wide drawers behind double doors are just not practical. I love food! 5: Build up bottom of unit to be flush with baseboards I did not understand how or why you did this? For the baseboards, we wanted the units to look built in and didnt have the ceiling height to add a platform for the PAX units to sit on for the baseboards to run in front of, so we had to steal some space from the bottom of the Pax for the baseboards to affix to. I cant find any on Ikeas site. Hope that helps! I am going to try this in a high end flip we are currently working on. We are doing a similar closet design now, inspired by your amazing blog!! Was putting a shelf divider on top of a shelf an issue? I had to build a perfectly level base for the cabinets and make sure the finishing would allow for some movement without the plaster or paint cracking. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. I had to settle for 201. We tried to be as detailed as possible in the below steps, so Im going to give a disclaimer that this post is massive. So that explains why nothing is sticking. Have you tried using a heavier coat of wallpaper glue? Thanks so much for the very detailed post. ), if theres anything youre particularly glad you did, or anything youd do differently now, etc. Then you wont need to worry about opening both doors. The shallower drawer installed perfectly into the deeper unit and looks exactly the same as the other drawers from the front . I was actually online today with an IKEA PAX design planner and she mentioned that I look you upisnt that something? I read your article and shared it  with literally everyone I know, I am in the process of finally updating my closet and I will be using the same paint and details. The sources are actually all linked in the reveal post of this space here (https://erinkestenbaum.com/2018/11/07/one-room-challenge-fall-2018-the-reveal-week-six-master-bedroom-closet/), where the ceiling light is the Rye Flushmount from Hudson Valley Lighting and the ceiling wallpaper is Farrow and Balls Closet Stripe in Downpipe. Once all the lights were installed, we moved on to the next step. We ordered these puck lights off Amazon and hardwired them into an electrical box, so we could switch them on and off when entering the room. That being said, having grown our skills today, we would potentially tackle the full build-out from scratch today (if we had the dedicated time), just because we love a new challenge ha! My question is regarding the wallpaper. Sure! The front of the shelves? Thank you so much for your response. This is stunning!! Thanks! Thank you! As you added spare shelves to match the height of the baseboard for the bottom of the wardrobes, I noticed you added a shelf divider (shown in your point 5). You two really did such a brilliant job with it; I cannot get enough! beautiful closet! For the paint, we used Farrow and Ball Inchyra Blue in the Modern Eggshell finish, and its one of my most favourite moody colours of all time. Your closet is awesome, Erin! Were strongly considering picking up the Wagner Flexio 3000, though, since weve ended up using the sprayer SO much more frequently than expected! Thank you!! If your floors are not level (old house problems), always start at the lowest point in the room and simulate where the top edge of the baseboard will fall, so you dont get into any trouble as you make your way around the room. Just wanted to let you know how popular your blogs are. The Ikea Pax is frequently posted all over Instagram and Pinterest. Thank you!! I am going to attempt doing this in my closet.. few quick questions Thank you for the details and the lovely photos. This is stunning and truly inspiring. Why did you have to do this? We are in the midst of doing ours much like you have and I have a question. I was just wondering what would you say was the difficulty level/your experience with woodwork? Could you please tell me how you were able to recreate the fronts on the drawers? Lastly, I painted the entire room in plain standard matte interior wall paint from the local DIY shop, mixed to match F&B London Clay. Working on an addition with closet and want to ensure I leave enough space between wall and cabinetry. Do you feel yours is still sturdy after 3 years? Omg you literally took my image from my brain, different color. Brummie,designer, artist and blogger. Would greatly appreciate any input! Interesting.. so I just installed 1 drawer and they are flush.. maybe the new ones do and the old ones didnt. I made sure the profiles were set back by the thickness of the plasterboard plus 3mm, to allow for a line of silicone sealant. Erin, you are my IDOL!!!!! I havent seen this option at ikea and am curious how you fastened the drawer hardware and right side drawer support wall? I thought as soon as we started taking out the old kitchen, itd probably show its age and just start falling apart. The 16mm screws worked perfectly, never protruding on the other side. Hope that helps, and good luck with your closet! Any chipping or lifting of the paint form the laminate? You say your Pax units are 29 deep and 13 but I cant find any pat units that are 29 deep? We found it was easiest to sand the edges of the poplar strip that would be exposed before installing. What advantage did buy the Pax units give you? great job, but why didnt you fill up the holes prior to priming 1. Ha! (C) 2021 - CHLOE DOMINIK. Then, I assembled the cabinets, put them on top of the base and leveled again. The cost was roughly 800 euros for the IKEA components, 150 for the other items and 55 for the wall paint. This is like the best hack ever!! Hi Erin, just coming across this post and its great! My closet size is similar in size as yours. This is just amazing! Thank you so much! Do you still like how the shelves holes have been plugged or maybe plugging it with wood filler would have been better in hindsight? , Hello! The kitchen is often a big selling point, and we knew our now 13yr old lowest tier ikea kitchen would hurt the value. We then test fit all the drawer fronts on to the drawers themselves using two screws per drawer, drilled from the inside of the drawer into the new front (make sure your screws arent too long that they come through the front of the drawer face). This wasnt our first carpentry project, but it was definitely our biggest one to date. Just curious they look very smooth from the drawer open pic. This isnt to say that they arent helpful to maximize storage, but its very challenging to make them look seamless in a high-end custom closet. Looks great! And did you prime the wallpaper with the rest of the system prior to painting, or did you cover and tape it off? This looks stunning!! So inspiring and such fun to marvel! So, this is a bit back of the envelope math and excludes any of the drawer hardware because that was gifted and is a big variable cost. Could you please tell me where the beautiful artwork is from and who the artist is? I understand now, about why you had to build up the base using the shelves. You can also add some art prints, your most treasured shopped purchases and fashion books. Please! The light switch on the side of the cabinetswhat type of clearance was needed inside of the drawer for an electrical box? Are you sure the one side is 29 deep? You inspired me so much so that I have now assembled 8 PAX units in my walk in. Youre one talented lady!! In order to reach all six of our closet units, we had to order extra extension cords. In 2013 we bought another house and rented out that house, and fully assessed the kitchen. You may be lucky enough to have a whole room dedicated to build up your wardrobe, then you might consider shelving from top to bottom on either side. We ran the baseboards all the way around the room, for a fully-built in look. It looks like in one of the photos that you moved your light switch. Im saving this for a future home. Cost-wise, I dont think we would have saved much by building out the entire closet from scratch in wood. IKEA does indeed sell the L-shape divider (called the Komplement frame divider) that allows you to install the narrowest drawers in a wider frame. On the exterior sides of the Pax units, we added some additional strips of poplar to give the sides a more finished look once painted. These we attached with construction adhesive and used clamps to hold them in place. Quick questionif we used your guide to trimming out a Pax, but we kept the drawer fronts the same, how do you think we could we go about making sure the drawers are level with the added trim, since there wouldnt be an extra drawer front and washer? How long would you estimate this project took to complete? We continued the wire through the ceiling (we have attic access and just drilled a hole on each side of the closet and fed it through  ). Ive shown this project to so many people, it really blows me away. I was curious though  as you approach the three-year mark, how is the paint holding up? Im a total beginner when it comes to DIY and may be an off-topic question, but would like to add a pegboard to the side of my PAX sliding door closet. Thank you so much! Ive seen a million Ike hacks! When it comes to paint, make sure to go with a paint that is rated for cabinetry, since the closet gets a lot of hands on use. 1  we didnt have any issues with the wood splitting We painted the removable shelves and drawer fronts separately in our garage (we created a spray booth to keep the paint contained). The drawer fronts were critical to my vision: the IKEA Pax drawers look very modular and modern to me, making them stick out like a sore thumb in our 1940s home. I almost had something there but your layout really looks good and we eliminated it based on your photo. It was a bandaid, but would get us 4-6yrs down the road, when wed have some money to do it properly. When I first started imagining how I wanted my closet to look, I became stuck on this image of Jenny Wolfs closet. How did you handle the transition between vertical trim and baseboards? Hey Erin! Definitely a cut above the usual IKEA hacks. I was really flummoxed about this step. Im not 100% sure what you mean by the bullnose, but the Metrie baseboards that we installed have a rounded profile on the top that gives it the decorative look. None have inspired me the way this one has. Hi Cathy  My apologies, I get a lot of comments and if I dont have an immediate answer to the question and need to do some research, they can sometimes fall through the cracks. Huge props and thank you for sharing. I am considering using the 3/4 inch think boards on all the cabinet drawer fronts. How did you hide/cover this in the end? The depth offered at Ikea is actually 22.8. If we had more time, we would have used a Kreg Concealed Jig with a Forstner Drill Bit for a more perfect round circle, but they look pretty great. And you were right about the drawers not sitting flush with the frame. Looks great! 36 inches across from unit to unit for example? We had previously done a good deal of trimwork and moulding installation, as well as constructed window benches and the like, but this was definitely the most involved. The floor is not only warped and concave, but it also vibrates slightly as you walk up and down. Did you prime first? I love your choice of color too. Thank you!! Its awesome to have such clear steps to follow. A month later, I have yet to move into my closet, and cant sleep in my own bedroom, because the smell is still unbearably strong. A few iron angles to fix the base to the wall, Small strips cut from the MDF board used for precise leveling, 16mm screws (to fix the profiles to the cabinets), Silicone sealant (specific type that prevents paint from cracking), Interior wall paint (color Farrow & Ball London Clay; I had it mixed at my local DIY store based on their store brand paint), Compact cordless screwdriver with adjustable angled coupling for working in really tight corners, Crowbar (useful for adjusting the base, getting it perfectly level). Would it be possible to post a floor plan of the project (how the wardrobe fits inside the room)? Beautiful closet. I just looked back again on the photos and I actually didnt prime the boards first before wallpapering :/ We didnt have any issues with peeling though on application. We attached the drawer fronts using screws into each corner through the back  theres more detail in step #12, Thank you Dont worry that the drawer fronts may not sit flush with the trim on the front of the units, we address that later. You are my hero, this is the most beautiful ikea hack that Ive ever seen, and your house is just beautiful. We gave about a quarter of it to my mother in law for her garage, and took half to our garage and installed it there. Stunning closet!!! Learn how your comment data is processed. Just curious how it has held up. This looks stunning!! Thank you! Also, did ikea already have the half-width drawer system shown at the bottom of the right most closet unit? This really capped off the built-in look and totally hid the gap from the top of the wardrobes to the ceiling. One to fill the gap and one to make a nice smooth finish before painting. | Made by Lur, 20 Inspiring IKEA Pax Closet Makeovers - JFY, Owner's Closet Inspiration and Design Board  The Wooden Tangerine, https://rstyle.me/+7C5F0X5LVSTqKyeaJ3pHgQ, Hacking the IKEA Pax into a Fully Custom Closet  Erin Kestenbaum  Global Blog, Master Closet Remodel  Alexis Strickland, 41 Best Closet Organization Ideas to Keep Your Space Neat and Tidy, Guncelkal.net - See how an interior designer hacked a basic Ikea Pax wardrobe into a lush, inky blue walk-in closet, https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/variera-cover-cap-white-00226315/, IKEA PAX Wardrobe Hacks - Hana's Happy Home. Hi Erin, I havent, but that sounds like it could be pretty fabulous! We were a bit bummed at first about having the shallow frames on the one side but its actually been AMAZING!! Do give me suggestions if you happen to have any. the 6 IKEA units + drawers + shelves were $1,300, and we spent about another $1,200 on the wood, trimwork (sponsored, but included at retail cost), primer, lights, paintable wallpaper, caulk, wood rods, and paint. So, I sought out a closet system that I could customize and paint to match my vision. I absolutely love the color choice! Whereas with the shoe shelves Im stuck to always putting my shoes there. For spray painting, Id start with a smaller project first to get the hang of it  we previously sprayed our bathroom vanity  because theres definitely a learning curve. Can you please share custom drawers s faces dimensions? did you bring wire. ), or build a soffit that comes down to the top of the Pax. You shared that you wallpapered after the drawers and shelves (on the hanging side) were in place and then primed. Did you just add the fronts to increase the depth of the drawers, or did you remove the original PAX drawer fronts and install your own? Thank you! And in this search, the IKEA Pax kept coming up as the most common, highest-rated, and budget-friendly closet system. There was literally no wear to it in 10 yrs. We also have an ikea PAX closet and Im having trouble finding baskets that fit in that little top shelf. Great job. This is where things start to really begin to look custom. Wow! What you have done is quite perfect. hey! Your email address will not be published. A little known secret is that IKEA sells packs of plugs designed to hide the many, many holes in the Pax system that are used for shelving, etc. Not putting anything on back wall makes sense to create a nice walkway. I love your attention to detail and vision. Incredibly well done. Wow, and wow. Hackers Help: Make a storage bed frame from kitchen high cabinets? Was the baseboard you used more in height than the actual base of the wardrobe frame? The project seems to be getting bigger as the ideas and inspiration from your posts flood in. Wed just bought our house and had very little money, so we bought the lowest run of the ladder ikea kitchen. I was thinking about installing the wardrobe frames without the cardboard back and just letting my shiplap walls show through the back. I am interested in the source of the ceiling light fixture and the ceiling wall paper. We added the drawer fronts purely for aesthetics and to make the cabinetry look built in and custom. Its the perfect spot for folded items (sweaters, jeans, shorts, etc) and shoes. If so how did you get the drawer front edging smooth, did you put a wood veneer tape on them edges:? This is where the Pax Planning tool on the IKEA website comes in handy. This looks so amazing, congratulations! Ok your ikea hack closet is just stunning! It looks amazing  can you share what size each of the drawer fronts is? Combining your wardrobe and home office is a great way to make use of your space. We have high ceilings (108) so we probably have the height to build a platform on which these PAX units can sit, and then cover the  edges of the platform all around with base board molding to give it a seamless, built in look. I am wondering if I could do the same but I have two  windows facing the entrance door and I dont really want to cut one off. Also, re: building up the drawer fronts: Do the IKEA PAX drawers not come with front frames? Thanks Erin. Although the most popular colour youre more than likely to see the Pax in, is the white option. Did you have to find extensions for your lights? Thank you! Im in the process of designing our IKEA pax closet and had a question  i noticed you did regular shelves instead of the slanted shoe shelves. And well documented. Any suggestions? This is so great! The closet paint is Farrow and Ball Inchyra Blue in Modern Eggshell and the bedroom is Benjamin Moore Smoke in the Regal Pearl finish. We used 1/2 inch thick Poplar boards that we cut down on the table saw to create strips to cover where the wardrobe units met and the filler boards on the sides, where the wardrobe units didnt quite reach the wall. If youve ever watched the Flatpack Empire, (all about Ikea). I am considering stacking two shelf dividers one over the other for my project and I would love to know if you had a problem/how your divider was attached to your shelf? We werent sure how the laminate would sand, so we opted for the plugs instead but I have seen people fill and sand since without any apparent issue. How did you attach them, glue? I had much better luck painting my closet shelves with BIN, which I did outside in the hot sun. You can see in the above shot that we had installed the plugs. Arent all drawers the same size? However, I am not quite understanding the whole mechanism of attaching the drawer fronts to existing drawers (even though it seems from all the comments, that you have really explained it as simplistically as possible). This is so dreamy and I would love to see a follow-up now that its been a few years! I initially assumed that we would make all the cabinetry from scratch, but Cory brought me back to reality with the truths that 1) wed never built a cabinet in our lives, let alone lots of drawers, shelves and boxes, and 2) the cabinetry would take forever, and would make this room impossible to accomplish for the One Room Challenge. Im trying to work it out but as Ive never assembled Ikea furniture Im not sure with these added extras if this would be possible? What is the width of the walkable area between the two cabinets (first photo in section 14)? Was it that much less expensive in the end? To install the drawer fronts, we taped the washers to hold them in place, as it is next to impossible to slip them in between the drawers and the wood front. Thanks! We also used glue to add shoe moulding to cap off the space between the baseboard and the floors. We just added the drawer fronts right on top of the existing drawer, so theyre super sturdy and stable, making the drawer fronts purely cosmetic . I hope im making sense! Then, I made the depth slightly less than the cabinets themselves, so the finishing plinth would recess just a millimeter or so backward.
