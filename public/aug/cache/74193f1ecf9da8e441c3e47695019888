In the latest edition 3 specification, the term "Voltage Protection Rating" or VPR is used instead of let-through or clamping voltage. There was a problem. Very few manufacturers are willing to risk money to meet their sales promises. NY 10036. Works great. Older surge protectors were typically designed around the concern that computers had spinning hard disk drives (HDDs) inside, and that it was better to lose surge protection and keep providing power than to drop AC power when protection had failed. Its AC sockets are also close to one another making this unit unsuitable for big wall wart chargers. You can compare surge protectors durability, or the period over which the MOVs will remain effective, by looking at the number of joules advertised for the product. Manufacturers of surge protectors certify their devices and measure their effectiveness, giving them a rating in Joules which is the amount of energy they can filter, and also its clamp voltage, which is the threshold. Industry reports and testing indicates these protections are effectively pointless, so we didnt consider their presence or absence in our testing and reviews. Heres why you can trust us. The company was founded in 1922 to manufacture car headlights, but by the 1950s it was making rotating warning lights for the police, fire and ambulance markets, and in 1982 it created the first surge protector, having created the first UPS (opens in new tab) system for PCs two years earlier. I am very pleased that I learned about the Anker Strip Surge Protector," said one reviewer. In these devices, current does not flow to ground, but is limited to acceptable levels so that electronic equipment is not damaged. We cant give this appealingly inexpensive smart outlet strip a high recommendation because the manufacturer hasnt provided us with specifics related to its power-handling capabilities or any indication of independent third-party electrical certification from the likes of Underwriters Laboratory or Intertek. This vertical power strip allows for sufficient space between outlets and optimizes the use of those outlets. A notable feature of this model is that it provides a fail-to-safe design, also referred to as "automatic shut down" by Tripp Lite. Power always flows, but the light turns off. Phone jacks and coax connectors dont add much to value to a surge protector. We selected three for every category. Additionally, this model also includes coax cable protection (CATV, satellite, etc.). This is a very flexible and adaptable surge protector, with an eight-foot cord and both protection and ground-fault indicators. A typical lightning strike can be measured at fifteen million volts, therefore, if you live in an area with frequent lighting, you should buy insurance as well. In terms of design, theres plenty of room to plug on oddly-shaped power pricks. Not this one. Youll also notice that the surge protectors we recommend have high joule protection ratings. If you're on a tight budget and your wallet is thin, then you need not look further. All six of its outlets can be controlled and scheduled individuallyand with a polished mobile app, no lessand you can also control any of them with voice commands.

The class of surge protectors reviewed here rely on MOVs (metal oxide varistors) to absorb excess voltage. USB outlets are handy - and I don't get any noise from the USB ports when using with audio devices which I have gotten with other USB chargers.". We evaluate these features in our surge protector reviews: Features you typically wont find in surge suppressors such as these are alarms or networked intelligence to alert a computer (and manage a controlled shutdown), or act as an Internet of Things device, to warn about electrical anomalies or provide a status report.

When that time comes with almost any other surge protector, youll need to toss it in the garbage. External power surges are typically caused by the restoration of power after an outage or blackout, aside from lightning strikes on the power grid. Because of this, it's essential to install AC wiring that complies with code and has proper earthing. Better to lose power than to let a surge through.
