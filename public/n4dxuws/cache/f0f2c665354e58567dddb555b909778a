Install bumpers (Fig 10) 1" to 2" below dock level. This allows for the production of 20, 24, & 36 high bumpers. See also WBDG Secure/SafeSecurity for Building Occupants and Assets.          uuid:402ef7ea-55d4-472a-82cf-822d3989aa7b The above general information about truck can aid in designing the loading dock, it is best to remember that each of the above truck heights can vary as much as 6" to 8" (12" if air-ride trailer suspension) in height from empty to fully loaded, this is know as "float". These simple inexpensive concepts can save you and your customers time and money further down the road. Service range of the variety of trucks to be service and mid-point.

When using 14 hole centers, height should be a minimum of 12. Ideally, the slope for any loading docks ramp should be as low as possible. When designing the dock it is a good practice to ask the client for a list of trucks serviced at the loading dock; i.e. Safety chains hold the ramp in place and the same 8-inch steel curbs guard the sides of the ramp. If a facility has special requirements for a loading ramps size or location, it is usually best to have a custom loading dock designed to suit the circumstances. The flow of circulation into the dock should pass this control point, and access should be restricted to authorized personnel. Yard Ramps from BHS have a similar build but allow for extra versatility.
