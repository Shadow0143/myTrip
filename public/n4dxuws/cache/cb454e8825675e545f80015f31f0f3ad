And I guess I initially felt like I would get people attacking me saying, Oh, you know, your art isn't that good, your calligraphy is not that good, I can do it better. But what I actually found is the response has been overwhelmingly kind, and I'm not sure if I've just been profoundly lucky with that, but I have gotten emails from people all over the world and Because our number one viewership is the US, but that's only 60% of people to visit the website, the other two biggies are Canada, in the United Kingdom. Thank you so much Lindsey. 29 min read, Lindsey Bugbee a.k.a: The Postman's Knock. And so I think it's been amazing to know that the website has that kind of impact, and it's been surprising for me to see how wonderful people can actually be.  I actually have a book from a woman who was inspired by our website, Kestrel Montez, who just wrote a practice workbook on modern calligraphy. I think that calligraphy, once you get the hang of it, is not overwhelming, it's something that you can do with intention and it's not incredibly fast, so it just sort of counteracts what we're experiencing with technology. And then I've gotten to work on a couple of books. It does look intimidating, the strange looking pens and the nibs and ink, but what would you say to someone that feels intimidated? The Nikko G isnt a calligraphy nib, it's for Manga which is Japanese illustration, and its made out of steel, and it's a fairly large nib, so it can hold a lot of ink, and it's just really great for beginners because it's not incredibly responsive, so if you are making a downstroke you have to press really hard for the times of the nip to split open and make that down stroke, which is really good, because as a beginner, you don't want an incredibly responsive nib, It can be fine for downstrokes, but for upstrokes, you just have to learn to regulate your pressure, and if the nib is too flexible, then you're going to get tines that play a little bit and you're going to get your ink spitting, so it's good to start off with a medium flex nib. Yeah, absolutely. Anybody can create calligraphy. The difference between a sketchbook and a bullet journal would be that sketch-booking is more general, whereas the themes of my bullet journals pages are more specific - either specific to a day or keeping track of goals. And it was one of the reasons I got into calligraphy, and then she reached out to me, she's reached out to me twice now to review her books, which is so neat because when I started, I was a nobody and I wouldn't have been on her radar at all but now she's asking me to review her books. Just relaxing, I guess. Let's see, I've had the fun ones - people who say, I made my own wedding invitations and I calligraphed all the envelopes Those are really fun. But really, since I'm not on social media a lot, I haven't connected with a ton of people that I really should connect with, and those are the people that just come to mind, but there are many, many more who create gorgeous things that are worth mentioning. So I took on the project and it was so cool because I'm handwriting these wedding invitations, and as I'm writing the wedding invitations, I was watching this actor in this actress on screen on Netflix as I'm creating their wedding invitations. Obviously, if you find The Postmans Knock, you're on a computer, you're on an iPad, you're on an iPhone, I love the potential for communication with technology; that said, I don't think that technology for me and for a lot of people is a good way to relax. So how does the dip pen work? Where we are right now? I think everybody feels that way. It's just one of those things that you have to take one step at a time, so it's not a difficult thing.                        Those hours are spent focusing, single-task focusing on exclusively on that person Lindsey Bugbee (left) and Tona Bell - Founder of The Paper Seahorse (right). So, okay, you have a lot of people that pay attention to what you do. So to me, I guess half of my mind is on the story that I'm listening to, and then the other half of my mind is, I guess just paying attention to what I'm doing, so I'm drawing out guidelines, I'm making slant lines to guide my slant, I'm dipping the pen into the ink, making sure that it's at an appropriate level. And I thought, Oh God, how hard can that be?  Like in the workshops I teach, there might be a couple of people in there who will say, Yeah, I'm here so I can learn to make money with my calligraphy, but mostly it's people that are there saying, I just need a way to learn how to relax, I need something meditative to do, and I think this is it for me.. What's going through your mind? My husband knows, I think. It really is an art. But I guess specifically, writing pretty and connected, you know, I guess you wouldn't look at beautiful block lettering, which means the letters aren't connected and say, Oh, that's some great calligraphy, it's more like it needs to be connected, at least in my mind.                      I'm not sure.  Thank you for inviting us into your home. So, that funny term, Insta-famous really applies to you. I mean, it was like a novel - if I printed it, it would have been three pages, just talking about how glad she was, she found my website, and it's funny because usually somebody's searching for one thing because we have a whole bunch of different tutorials, you know, there might be something about crayons or colored pencils or water color, but then there's a lot about calligraphy, so you sort of go down this rabbit hole, so a lot of emails will start off and say, I was looking for this, but then I also found this on your website. Or for myself? And yeah, so that's what I do, I guess. So I started The Postmans Knock with the idea that I would be creating these envelopes and people would get excited when they heard The Postmans Knock because they'd be getting these beautiful envelopes. I'm not thinking about anything.  I'd like to share that. So I had been creating calligraphy for a while and sort of blogging about it and using these speedball nibs, and this man named Roger Mayeda from Albuquerque, New Mexico reached out to me and he said, First of all, hey, I think maybe you would find success with the Nikko-G nib, have you thought about using that needs sort of medium flex? I'm a blogger, calligrapher, artist and entrepreneur. It's so fast and it gives us the potential to communicate so quickly, and I think that we're inundated with so much technology that you almost overlook when you're being communicated with that way, it's very easy to ignore a text, or even when you open up your mailbox and you see that you've gotten an envelope where your name is printed on it, I think you automatically give that less importance than the envelope where something's written out. And as far as what I see for The Postmans Knock specifically, I would just like to be able to share more of what I know with people. In general? Add description, images, menus and links to your mega menu, A column with no settings can be used as a spacer, Link to your collections, sales and even external links, by Tona Bell May 27, 2021 And as far as where I see it going, I really don't know. And that's a curious thing because you're very in the moment, but then time also speeds up because you're doing something that you really enjoy and that's relaxing you. That's what I want to do. Now, if you ask me what I want to do, yeah, I want to ship stuff out, I would love to get into watercolor a little bit more, I love watercolor, so I'd love to have some resources teaching people how to create watercolors, or not watercolor specifically, but watercolor paintings.  That's so fun.                      So I think it's just a mixture of being completely engaged with my writing and with this podcast, and then also feeling anticipation. So what is the difference between an upstroke and a downstroke. Lets take a moment to think about that. So you evolved into teaching. Well, I really think that anyone can do it because you can write already - you know how to write a letter. That's a little bit more popular, I would say, than the dip pen because it only requires a marker to create, and then still others would argue that calligraphy is just pretty penmanship.  So I went to a local craft store and I found a Speedball kit, and I didn't know anything about calligraphy, so I thought, Okay, well, these things -I didn't know what a nib was - look like they all work. I got them home and they were just awful.  I would say that calligraphy looks very intimidating. What does it feel like when you're writing? And then you know, you have to think about to what the form that something is taking communicates.  And the nature of art is that people have different styles, so I think that what one person is into is going to be completely different from what someone else is into. Okay, so the story of the famous Nikko G nib Do you want to take it from the beginning? How is the experience of writing by hand different from when you're writing on a computer or an iPad or a phone?  I'm writing, and I suppose I just feel completely relaxed at that point, and then also excited because if you're writing something, 95% of the time, it's because someone is going to see it, so even the place cards that I'm working on today, as I'm creating them, I'm thinking about the reaction that people are going to have to them, it's going to elevate the gathering that we're having from just to gathering in the home to something truly elegant. That's been cool. 2 min read  1 Comment, by Tona Bell February 05, 2022 It's very easy if your mind isn't really in, it to skip a letter or mess up on the letter you're making, so you really have to concentrate on what you're doing. I don't know. To me, when I sit down to create calligraphy, in my ideal situation, I'm really interested in people and stories, so I mostly listen to podcasts, specifically true true-crime podcast while I'm creating calligraphy. So yeah, it's opened up a lot of really cool doors for me. I started in 2012. I really don't know where it's going with handwriting. For example, one of my batiques toured New York while I was in high school, and my mom said, Why would you major in that? When you are sitting at your desk and you're making calligraphy how does it feel? So I guess Well, I'm not sure that I would even call myself into famous, I've got 100,000 or so followers on Instagram, which really isn't much compared to a lot of people, and I think as far as people paying attention to what I do, it's nice for me because they mostly just pay attention to the art and calligraphy aspect. But you can use calligraphy for anything, for sure.-. I wasn't having ink battering issues anymore, and it was kind of like having a bike with training wheels. I don't know. Second, you need to familiarize yourself with the instrument, which in my case would be a dip pen. So it looks like the popularity of the Nikko G nib is coming from me, but really, it's all coming from you know, this guy in Roger Mayeda in Albuquerque! So the last question is, what do you think people should really know about calligraphy and writing pretty that they may not already know? Now, it has to be really enjoyable, so you need to be making things that ignite your passion for this art, so whether you're making mail art, your sketch-booking, you're working on a bullet journal, you just need to make your practice fun because practice is mostly where your higher skill level is going to come from. When it started evolving into a teaching website, it would have been probably about 2014 or 2015, because that's when I became very serious about the blog on the website, because when I had studied at University of Kansas, my internship had actually been in editing, so I was doing blogging for Mother Earth News, which is based in Topeka, Kansas. So that's a good feeling. Now, I realized the problem was they were too flexible, which means that the tines of the Nib were just a little finicky, and if I would have been better at calligraphy and known I was doing I could have used them, but I wasn't, and I didn't. If I'm putting a picture on Instagram, because for me, it's about the art and it's about the calligraphy, I think really the Insta-famous thing, which again, I'm not even sure I would classify me as that, I would just say that it's been good because I'm finding these super nice people who are into the same thing that I'm into, whereas I have a great group of friends in my everyday life, but they're all aerospace engineers, are working on wind farms or whatever, nobody is really into calligraphy, and one of my aerospace friends did take a workshop for me, and that was fine, but you know, they're just not into it, like some people around the world are that are writing to me.
