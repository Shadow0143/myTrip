We are very happy with our couch and so is our cat! We also live up a skinny staircase with smaller-than-average doors. The boxes were waiting for me when I got home and, after unboxing, it took me no more than 15 minutes to get both pieces set up. Great product overall! I have a neck injury and I'm really picky about where I sit and that I have enough support, and most sofas I tried didn't feel right. It is AWESOME! Why am I still writing a 5 star review then? I have a 14 month old and a 2.5. year old. I love that it's stain resistant too! The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is I feel it is a bit over priced. The cushions were a little harder than I expected but not uncomfortably so. Overall, a great purchase. With the assurance of an easy return, we purchased our first sofa, received it and immediately bought the love seat. There were issues in the beginning which led me to having the opportunity to talk to the CEO. Easy instructions and appears to be exactly what I wanted. Looking forward to more Burrow living room pieces. I needed a new couch, something nicer than IKEA but still fitting a tight budget. I would say it was fairly easy to put together and didn't take more than an hour to do so.The directions were not tailored to this specific couch; there was no mention of the chaise lounges. One of the foot thumbscrews was missing, but David in customer service sent me another within a few days and it wasn't enough to keep us from using it right away. Quality couch, easy to assemble and looks great! Purchased my sofa back in the fall but aside from some understandable delay with shipping, everything went really smoothly with the assembly (much easier than ikea furniture) and the couch is incredibly comfy. burrow was the perfect option for us - it fits perfectly into our decor, is very comfortable, and allowed us to get a larger sofa than we would have been able to otherwise. My husband and I have had the couch (3 seats, navy blue) for about a month now. My only complaint, and hope it is currently in the works, is that there isn't a corner piece to turn the sofa into a sectional. I just wish they sold corner sectional pieces or at least an end piece for a footrest. The delivery was so quick and loved having easy to manage boxes for each seat. Recommend you get a fabric swatch before you order online! I brought my mom to a Burrow Sofa showroom nearby Little Italy in Manhattan and I have to say, trying to get my mom off the sofa was so difficult!!! Either the top pin would line up for the seat back, or the bottom pin set for the seat. It is so comfortable and incredibly high quality. Depending on where you look, you can save $100s for higher quality pieces that can fit even the most unique style.If you are ready to learn more about the best rated online furniture stores and brands that shoppers love, read our reviews for the top 2022 Furniture Stores. Great couch! Assembling was a dream and when I decide to relocate, breakdown and transport will be too because of the modular design. The Burrow fit these needs. frequent moves), Awesome couch and great buying experience. This sofa is much more shallow than any sofa I have previously owned. It's a nice couch. Purchased the three seater with high arms and an ottoman. I'm thinking about purchasing the matching chair in the near future. We love our Burrow! We haven't slept on it with the sleeper mattress yet, but the topper is really nice quality and I think it'll make for a comfortable place for our guests to sleep. I am really impressed with Burrows and would definitely recommend their products. Overall a great purchase. Soft and durable! Super comfortable, like I never want to leave it ever. If I had more space I would definitely buy the chaise to accompany it. This was a primary concern of ours, but we've been very happy with the depth. We were due for an upgrade from and aging Ikea couch. When I moved into my apartment, we couldn't get my old couch through the front door--didn't expect that!--and found it difficult to find something decent ever since. The couch looks beautiful in our living room and was so easy to put together. Like all things you read on the Internet, understand there is no better judge than yourself. Super easy to set up and very comfortable. The fact that the cushions are reversible and the couches are interchangeable is the icing on the cake. I am so happy with this couch! I was a bit hesitant buying out sofa online, but after reading all of the details, learning about the features, and watching every video, I knew I had to invest in this sofa. I could have fixed it myself, but I didn't have a power drill. I'm a Manhattan resident and with the fast paced lifestyle I need a an easy couch that's get up and go like me. Easy instructions, no tools required. Anyway I can get some spare thumbscrews? Love, love, love the sofa and loveseat. I put it together myself in less than 30 and it was extremely straightforward. Other couches are too deep and I feel that I have to have a pillow behind me to be comfortable. After finally being able to flee the local furniture mart, I sat down to search for online retailers. It's a great looking couch, and super easy to put together. I now have two extra couch cushions I don't know what to do with and it wasn't made clear that this would happen. Just enough stick that they keep their claws in). Our first guest actually spilled coffee on our new couch, and initially I panicked, but the fabric was easy to clean with water and it left no permanent stain. My wife & I were able to setup our Burrow in under 10 minutes. Overall though EXCELLENT product, I'm very happy and will certainly be recommending Burrow to others and looking for more designs of theirs in the future. I am 5'2 110 pound mom of two boys so I expect spills and messes and general wear and tear daily. They were pretty easy to assemble, but they were more difficult to assemble than I predicted. If you use one of these and buy something, Slumber Search may make a small amount of money. One thing that was difficult however is that the boxes were a lot bigger and heavier than I anticipated and if I didn't have help I don't know if I would have been able to drag them up 2 flights of stairs. And the USB port on the side impresses all of my friends and keeps my iPad charged when I need it while lounging! I definitely think you need 2 people to carry the boxes and assemble the sofa. Super easy to assemble and super convenient to carry up the stairs to my 3rd story apartment. This couch is awesome! So far, so good. I look at nearly every company to try and find the perfect sofa. The sofa looks stunning when combined with mid-century modern furniture. Just right. The Burrow sofa delivers thoroughly on its promise! Withstanding 3 cats so far with no issues. I put it all together in under an hour. Easy to assemble..Love the colors and prompt delivery !! It's SUPER comfortable and that was my main concern. We are looking forward to expanding our couch with another module when we move into a larger house. Easy enough to move and assemble alone, but would definitely recommend getting some help. The boxes that it comes in were larger than I expected and awkward to maneuver; it would be nice if they had some kind of handles attached. My girlfriend and I had just moved to a new place and we needed a couch. So I decided to try Burrow. I have recommended this couch to all of our friends. I get a ton of compliments on how good the sofa looks, and I find it to be extremely comfortable. I am very pleased I am a senior citizen female but I was able to assemble the sofa with no problems - very easy. Only a minor problem in that the cushion (which is very comfortable) is just slightly wider/deeper than the bench is. We were psyched to have an easy couch to put together after moving across the country. Right away, I loved the clean lines. And the Burrow is so comfortable that I feel totally okay offering it up as a bed for our overnight babysitter, and I've fallen asleep on it myself more than a few times. Delivery service, packaging, and assembly was easy. This is my first big furniture purchase and I couldn't be happier. Leather looks and feels great. Looks fantastic as a centerpiece in my living room. My neighbors like it so well that they are looking at buying one for their home. I fear i will have to return if it doesn't feel better during the trial perios. It is also beautiful and super high quality! Just what I needed to create a welcome & useful entrance. Great pieces of furniture. In the end, we are keeping the sofa! It looks great and is high-quality. The cushions are firm, and at 2 weeks in, it is growing on us. So the burrow was perfect for that. We actually did a FULL REVIEW with images and video about this sofa in particular and it can be seen at https://www.athletesinsight.com/Burrow-review/ This is a purchase you will NOT regret! Carried all up a narrow stair to a new space over the garage. It is not uncomfortable by any means, but after reading reviews I had high expectations and it is not as comfortable as my other couches. My two dogs love it too and so far it's been holding up to all the scratching. I would compare it to a couch from some "high end" brands I've seen in stores and online. Just got rid of the old one which is so bulky in comparison. Overall, love it. The USB port is a thoughtful addition. So pleased. Amazing! The pros: Uniquely designed, interesting modular shelving in solid wood. I also love the product so far. Sleek and modern without compromising on comfort. I don't like how the black looks and think different wood options would add to the appearance of the couch. Customers report sturdy materials for the price with their seating offering medium-firm cushioning with competitive durability, especially for the price. Late night roommate living room chats over Mexican food never felt so comfortable. Proper upgrade from our huge love seat and ottoman. Assembly was easy and straightforward, quality and comfort are great. Instructions were included on the boxes themselves and an instruction manual, which all made assembly a breeze (it took my husband and I maybe 30 minutes). The reviews here are aggregated from other sources across the Internet and although we have tried only to find trustworthy reviews, the content and scores here may be subject to manipulation by agents acting on behalf of manufacturers and marketers. 4 sofa leg screws were missing. It's comfortable for a nap or overnight sleep (tried that a few times too). The burrow couch was slick and easy to put together. Ordered my Burrow based on color photos which indicated a dark gray "charcoal" color. The Bento coffee table works well in small spaces because of its minimalist style. It is bulky when putting together, but the instructions were clear cut. The couch itself is nice and supportive, just the right amount of firmness for me. So much easier to get into my house (small door frame!) I was tired of feeling squished & uncomfortable on my small hard futon. The assembly was very straightforward and easy. However, I am quite pleased with my experience. Comfortable. This couch is very easy to put together and will be very easy to move. Enough room for two of us to lay! I live in a building built circa 1880 complete with narrow, winding staircases and low ceilings. Great Customer service and follow up. I'm really happy with it. I would recommend Burrow to anyone and everyone. I looked all over the internet and went to several stores and found the experience to be really cumbersome and lacked a lot of transparency. I also really appreciated the customer-side design details: boxes that I could carry upstairs by myself, ease and sensibility of assembly, the little packet of hardware that swings down when you first open the box so you can't miss it! My husband kept saying "that's it?" We were on a budget, but didn't want to by cheaply made furniture. The couch was so easy to put together which I was able to do by myself. It was great that we could easily add this matching item. I moved cross-country and the moving company I chose (Colonial Van Lines) broke my couch in transit. We worry about the legs holding up over time with our toddler but will re-rate as time passes and update review. The slim design makes my room feel bigger but still provides more cushion space then previous couches I have owned. So far we've gotten rave reviews from friends and family about the comfort and space. We were pleasantly surprised to find that a couch you can build fairly easily out of a box would be so comfortable and fairly sturdy. Cons: The power cord is not quite long enough to hit our nearest plug, so we linked it to a power strip. And it looks great. It is a great looking modern sofa, and comfortable as well. You cannot go wrong with these, I promise. Furniture shopping is an oftentimes tedious and mundane task. The are very sturdy and look great. Ordered using a Black Friday promo. Putting it together was a breeze. After owning a Burrow sectional sofa for one year exactly, the sofa cushions are not holding their shape, the fabric is loose, the fabric is pilling, the legs won't stay attached, the back doesn't truly lock so it is always wiggling/moving behind you, etc. The back height is perfect to comfortably sit and watch tv. It allows me to keep my peripherals charged at all times without leaving the comfort of my entertainment center. Wow is it comfy. Toddler tested and approved. I love the couch and the ability to break it down and move it easily. Frees up space in the room while adding more seating. Burrow is fairly priced and the free shipping is great. Was easy to put together and looks great! The only complaint that I would have honestly is the USB charger. I was a little on the fence, only because I don't typically make purchases this large online without seeing the product in person, but this was exactly what I was hoping for and expecting. What a simply brilliant solution to a common problem. It arrived quickly, so easy to assemble with 1 exception. I love the mid-century modern look and was pleased that removing the old couch was the last time I will have to take a door off the hinges for the sake of a place to sit. Now, the couch and I are very happy together, firm and comfortable. Would totally recommend and am thinking about purchasing another module to extend the couch into a four seater. The couch itself is excellent too! I'm thrilled to have a piece of furniture this comfortable that I also don't have to dread moving. The power outlet under the seat cushion is super handy. It was pretty easy to assemble, just as advertised. Very clever mechanisms that can be put together and taken apart without losing their integrity each time. We needed a sectional-style couch for our renovated basement. I was pleasantly surprised by the Burrow product- the couch is comfortable, nice looking, and easily handles the active behavior of my kids. I was skeptical, but everything came, it was put together within an hour, and the couch is great! This is probably not typical for Burrow, since the co founders reached out to apologize with a hand written letter (which I thought was very nice of them, they actually noticed). Camel top-grain leather sofa. It was such a thrill to receive our Burrow couch. I would highly recommend Burrow! Easy to put together and easily fits 3 of us lounged. It is taking a beating well from a 5 and 2 year old. It's comfy and the exact size we wanted. PS - I also purchased the Cape Cod House rug in Dark Gray. Seat depth seems a bit small and caused initial doubt in whether we would keep it, but all other positives made it worth keeping. Definitely happy with our purchase. The ability to just add to the sofa is honestly what makes this a great piece of furniture. I live in a townhouse with the primary living space on the second floor. Received in less time than projected. I'm short! A few came broken, but I was able to make it work. Biggest flaw, the removable ottoman. They fabric pops and makes your room look amazing. Really appreciate Burrow giving me the wooden legs for it as well. everything else was a breeze. We are happy with your purchase! Despite being something you assemble, it's extremely sturdy and never feels like it's coming apart like other sectionals. Seriously. So glad I went with Burrow - I'm in love with the charcoal color that I bought! They were very difficult to break down and take to our recycling area though. The fabric is very nice, not at all cheap looking. We LOVE how comfortable and stylish our couch is! 6 months later and I still have no regrets. I highly recommend it. At each step of the process the team members I spoke to were optimistic and helpful. I saw these amazing Burrow reviews on YouTube and I fell in love. Assembly took 30 minutes with 2 people. Modern - sleek grey color, simple ascetics Convenience - Came in 5 boxes (ordered chaise piece), 15 min put together time Comfort- Broke in quickly, not too stiff Needed a couch that would be portable and stylish living in a small apartment. Everything about the Burrow sofa is awesome. Highly recommend it for first-time apartment buyers! Can't fit a couch through narrow the narrow doors of your pre-war walk-up? Came in box and it was very Easy to setup. I was frustrated with the shipping, as I was given an incorrect, earlier shipping date first and then emailed to ask why it wasn't here, and was given a correction. This couch is awesome! I got a grey armchair from Burrow and absolutely love it. First in providing a discount when the couch was delayed, then timely feedback and updates as the process went on, and ultimately a painless process to execute a refund. I'm not the most stylish, but my GF and mom both said they really liked the look of it! Perfect for city living. This couch looks great and is comfortable for a short time. The only reason Im giving it four stars instead of five is because my sofa has a tiny squeak sound when you sit on it. I was worried that this would be a glorified ikea couch, but this couch stands alone. I love that I could break it down again and put in in a car when I move. Really impressed with fabric quality, leg construction. I put to together as we were waiting for the dinner to show up via uber eats. Overall very happy. Comfy, sturdy, and damn good looking. Once assembled, you're rewarded with a sturdy, spacious, handsome, and comfortable couch! I truly appreciate solid design that is beautiful and also sensical, and this is all of that. Thank you! Great quality, easy assembly, worth the price. I'm a 5' 5" female and was able to put it together myself (for the most part - just needed help putting it upright and moving it) and I absolutely love the way it looks. We had our Burrow for over a year and ran into an unexpected issue, which was totally our fault - Burrow came through and helped us fix it up! Burrow Support has great customer service as well! Burrow has taken the online furniture space by storm. In the end the couch wasn't exactly what I was looking for but my experience with the Burrow team was excellent. 15 min for couch, 5 for the chaise. I ordered a one-seater about a month ago and I've been really happy with it so far. The sofa is great and exactly what I expected. Easy to solo and simple instructions. First of all, the sofa is beautiful. Very easy to set up and very comfortable!! Burrow under promised and over delivered on this product. With a mid-century and contemporary themed catalog, they have expanded over the years to include beds, shelves, tables, rugs, and more. ', I've had my Burrow for over a month now and absolutely love it! Best couch we've ever had. As a single guy with no help, the "worst" of it was moving the afore-counted boxes and disposing of the packaging afterwards; the items assembled easily, appear sturdily built (and carefully crafted), and are comfortable. They quickly sent me replacement parts, and when they arrived everything went together without issue. We received out Burrow couch a couple weeks ago and couldn't recommend more. Couch. Quick and easy assembly. It is very comfortable and we are pleased with it so far!
