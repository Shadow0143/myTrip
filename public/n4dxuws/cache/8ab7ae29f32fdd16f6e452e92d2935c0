When you buy through our links, we may earn a commission. But the MX Master 3 is typically more than twice as expensive as our other picks. Logitech claims that the Triathlons single AA battery will last for two years, which is above average longevity even for other mice that run on AA batteries. Our devices are getting smaller and more powerful all the time. We'd also be doing a disservice if we didn't mention the similarly exceptional Logitech G PRO X SUPERLIGHT, which is far and away the closest competitor for the Viper V2 Pro.  This mouse is much more compact than the original, and it now sports a symmetrical shape, making it a more viable choice if you're left-handed. This allows you to pick and choose depending on which machine you're using at any given time. The scroll wheel felt cheaper to us, and it lacks the Triathlon wheels useful toggle between smooth and ratcheted scrolling, but its adequate for browsing the web and scrolling large documents. Logitech claims that both models have two years of battery life, and you can customize any of the five buttons within the Options software. It's nowhere near as accurate or functional as our more premium picks here, but this is a good option for those on a tight budget. Here you can vote for our next review, Compare graphs from our mouse test results in order to make a clearer and more informed decision. The Marathon connects only via USB dongle, though, and we think most people should get a mouse like the Triathlon that can connect via Bluetoothespecially considering that many laptops nowadays lack USB-A ports. The symmetrical shape works for lefties and righties, and our panel testers liked its grip, shape, button selection, and scroll wheel. May 06, 2022: Even better, you can toggle through those Bluetooth devices by pressing a button. The mouse itself performs well on numerous surfaces, perfect for when you're traveling, even if it's a little on the heavier side. Our pick has eight accessible buttons, including an application switcher button and the Bluetooth device toggle, and you can customize most of them using Logitechs Options software. It's also more affordable than ever before. You can toggle between a precise notched scrolling mode or a faster free-scrolling mode, which is a much-loved productivity feature absent on the larger version. The MX Master 3 can track on glass and mirrored surfaces, toobut its typically more than twice as expensive as our other picks. It's powered by a single AA battery, and Logitech advertises up to 24 months of battery life. Compared to our ambidextrous pick, the Mobile Mouse 3600, the M650L Left has silent clicks and a less satisfying scroll wheel, and our testers with average-size hands found the M650L to be a bit long for a comfortable palm grip. If youre confident that you dont need Bluetooth, buy the Marathon. If you need a wireless mouse thats more comfortable to use with your left hand, we recommend the ambidextrous Microsoft Bluetooth Mobile Mouse 3600 instead. It doesn't approach the same level of performance or have the same wealth of features, but it has a very slim and portable shape and is much more affordable. (Most mice that attempt to accommodate left-handed people have ambidextrous designs that put buttons on both sides of the mouse, but our testers have found that these tend to get in the way.) It's only marginally heavier but doesn't perform as well. If your mouse dies earlier than you expect, it may be because the mechanical switches under the buttons have failed. Affordable with a heavy focus on connectivity, Easily switch between Bluetooth or 2.4 GHz AFT, Comfortable to use with good battery life, Simple, affordable, and gets the job done, The best mouse you can buy for a Surface PC, Excellent buttons and scroll wheel behavior, Wireless (Bluetooth) or wired (USB) options, Robust software that lets you run on three PCs at once, Reliance on Bluetooth can be problematic for some, Not overtly better than Logitech MX Master 2S, We check over 250 million products every day for the best prices, The dream of NFTs in Minecraft was a lie, and Mojang Studios was right to end it, Microsoft News Roundup: Four Windows Insider builds, in-person Ignite, Intel losing $500 million, and more. These are the features you should look for in a wireless mouse, in rough order of importance: We tested each mouse for about a days work on a Windows laptop and a Mac laptop to evaluate its comfort, button placement, and software. The symmetrical shape works for both lefties and righties, and our panel testers liked its grip, shape, button selection, and scroll wheel. Although we cant precisely test that estimate, long-term testing by several Wirecutter staffers has indicated that the battery lasts a very long time. This mouse connects via Bluetooth and recharges with a USB-C to Lightning cable. The seenda Wireless Mouse is available in a bajillion different colors and has a comfortable-enough shape, but it lacks an on/off switch, doesnt come with a AA battery, and has only three buttons. With this most recent version, Logitech has added quieter click buttons and an improved sensor with a wider CPI range, which is particularly useful if you use a 4K display. In the past, wireless mice didn't perform nearly as well as wired mice and they typically had lackluster battery life. It has a rechargeable battery that can last about two months on a single charge. If you're looking for a much simpler option, we recommend the Logitech Pebble M350. It also has an impressive advertised battery life of up to 70 days. Survey: What is the biggest barrier to a potential Surface Duo 3's success? This little companion pointer doesn't scream premium features, nor does it command a high price, but allows you to ditch the touchpad in favor of a more convenient external input device. The Razer Basilisk X HyperSpeed is our favorite cheap wireless gaming mouse.                 Updated text for clarity and accuracy; no changes to picks. For MMO and MOBA games, you need a mouse with good sensor performance and click latency and plenty of programmable buttons for all your spells, abilities, and custom macros. Heres why you can trust us. By default this side scroll wheel is set to horizontal scrolling, which is great for graphic design, video editing, and large spreadsheets, but weve also found that configuring it to scroll between browser tabs is life-changing. In our tests, the Triathlon had crisp-feeling left- and right-clicks and responsive, easy-to-reach side buttons, but the application-switcher button on the bottom of its thumb grip felt mushy. It also has a rechargeable battery instead of a replaceable one, which means when the battery degrades youll need to replace the whole mouse. The Logitech Signature M650 has similar flaws, with the addition of being smaller and not quite tall enough. has fun RGB lighting, but it doesnt glide smoothly on a desk, its flat shape is uncomfortable to hold, and its scroll wheels smooth texture makes it difficult to find enough purchase to scroll. This wired-only model has comparable performance, and it's one of the very few MMO mice that's well-suited for small hands as you can adjust its 12-button side panel to suit your hand size. This battery can last for up to 12 months, depending on use, though you, unfortunately, won't be able to recharge the mouse not unless you use specific rechargeable batteries and bring a charger with you. Should your laptop or table already sport built-in Bluetooth, you won't require the use of an external dongle, but Logitech includes it just in case your Windows PC does not. The Logitech Signature M650L isnt as comfortable as the Triathlon or M585, it lacks multi-device switching, and our testers didnt love the lack of tactile feedback on its quiet click mechanisms. The best wireless keyboards are comfortable, reliable, and a joy to type on, whether you want a compact option like the Logitech K380 or something full size. Unlike our other picks, the Mobile Mouse 3600 can pair with just one device at a time via Bluetooth, and it doesnt come with a USB wireless dongle. The ambidextrous Mobile Mouse 3600 is comfortable for left- and right-handed use, but its smaller, it has fewer buttons, and it can connect to only a single device via Bluetooth. The Logitech Lift is a vertical mouse, which means you hold it in a 'handshake position.' While it has impressive sensor performance and click latency, you don't need to be a gamer to appreciate what this mouse offers. The five buttonsleft-click, right-click, and left, right, and down on the scroll wheelfelt crisp, and the soft-touch scroll wheel was one of the best we tested, with ratcheted scrolling and sturdy, easy-to-activate left and right tilts. Please refresh the page and try again. As a result, its a little less comfortable for righties, but its a great option for anyone who uses a mouse with their left hand.             so that you can compare the results easily. In the Windows-only Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center software, you can map app-specific settings, swap the left- and right-click functions, remap the scroll-wheel click, and alter scrolling sensitivity. It comes with a three-year limited warranty. This mouse doesn't have the same features as more premium productivity models like the MX Master series of mice, but its shape is better suited for small and medium-sized hands, and there's a left-handed version available. While it may be priced to match other budget-friendly offerings, Microsoft has managed to work in some additional features and better design in a mouse that looks and feels more expensive. Those left and right tilts on the scroll wheel work only for horizontal scrolling, though, and cannot be remapped. More premium options in Logitech's productivity-minded MX series might garner lots of attention, but the Logitech M720 Triathlon quietly offers many of the same features at a much more affordable price point, making it a standout choice for any budget-minded professional. The MX Master 3s back and forward buttons are differentiated and easy to reacha huge improvement over the awkward, diagonally stacked buttons on its predecessor. Most notably, the MX Master 3 has a second scroll wheel for your thumb, plus five other programmable buttons that you can customize with the Logitech Options software. This failure can happen for a variety of reasons, including humidity, how hard you click, and even regular use. It also has excellent build quality and is more than comfortable enough for marathon gaming sessions. Kimber Streams has been reviewing wireless mice at Wirecutter since 2014, combing through studies about hand sizes and computer ergonomics, soliciting the opinions of left- and right-handed panel testers of all hand sizes, and living with our picks for years. The mouse is available in Glacier, Matte Black, Pastel Blue, Mint, and Peach colors. The MX Master 3 is particularly comfortable for people with bigger-than-average hands, but it isnt too large for average hands; it measures 4.9 inches long, 3.3 inches wide, and 2 inches tall, in contrast to the Triathlon, which is 4.5 inches long, 2.9 inches wide, and 2 inches tall. The previous author of this guide, Justin Krajeski, also coordinated two in-person testing panelsone in Los Angeles and one in New York Cityto learn what people look for in a wireless mouse. Mice store-bought and tested, supported by you via. It means you'll have a less advanced sensor, but it still has dependable accuracy with support for up to 7,200 DPI. We've also added the Logitech Lift as our 'Best Ergonomic Wireless Mouse' and the Logitech MX Master 2S as our pick for the 'Best Mid-Range Wireless Mouse'. The similar Microsoft Bluetooth Ergonomic Mouse doesnt come with batteries, and although it was comfortable, it felt hollow and cheaper than our picks. Be careful not to get too caught up in the details. On paper, it's a gaming mouse, but it also comes in as the best general wireless mouse we've tested. The light-color design may lead to more frequent cleaning to avoid marks, and the reliance on Bluetooth technology may be a negative for some. If you spend all day using a mouse, we recommend investing in the Logitech MX Master 3. Our picklike most miceis contoured for people who mouse with their right hand. Altogether, this mouse isn't just the best Bluetooth mouse for desktop Mac setups but also thebest mouse for MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and iPad users currently available. Its comfortable for all grips and hand sizes, though especially for people with bigger hands. The MX Master 3s contoured shape and thumb rest make it just as comfortable to use for long periods as our other picks. For Mac users, we recommend the iconic Apple Magic Mouse 2. It's also capable of reading up to 220 inches per second and can handle 30G acceleration. The Logitech MX Master 2S is one of our favorite wireless mice around. Overall, an excellent package. And like our other picks, it supports Logitech Flow, which lets you move your cursor and copy-and-paste between multiple computers on the same network. The Microsoft Surface Precision Mouse is expensive, and although it was very comfortable in our tests, weve seen owner reports warning of connection issues. We've also overhauled our Notable Mentions section to include fewer, more relevant recommendations. One gaming mouse product designer told us that wireless mice were more susceptible to this problem because their lower voltagewhich saves battery lifecould accelerate corrosion in the switch. It also has updated Gen 3 optical switches and slightly improved battery life over older models. He carries things every day. It uses Logitech's USB Unifying Receiver to connect wirelessly and has an advertised battery life of over 250 hours using a single AA battery. But its smaller than our other picks, it has fewer buttons, it can connect to only one device at a time via Bluetooth, and its compatible with fewer operating systems than our top picks are. PC games need mice with more than just right and left click buttons, and we have great wired and wireless options for almost every price point. If you're interested in a lighter option, the SteelSeries Aerox 9 Wireless has a lightweight honeycomb body design and is an impressive 23g lighter. Though our panelists had a wide range of hand sizes, their average measurements aligned with the average hand measurements we had found in several studies: 4 inches (palm), 3.3 inches (finger), and 7.7 inches (spread).
