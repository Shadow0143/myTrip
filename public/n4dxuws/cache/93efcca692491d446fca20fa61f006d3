Has anyone used this product? Has anyone had any issues with the Smartcore floors fading? I do have one spot on my floor where you can see that the floor did not lock in, however it can be interpreted as not being installed correct. It isn't rocket-science! I just uploaded a pic from Lowe's website. I installed it myself and it was very easy to lay down. This cookie is set by GDPR Cookie Consent plugin. The floor is not even and we didnt level it- so the baseboard molding has done gaps. You also have the option to schedule an in person appointment at our offices in NYC, London, Hong Kong or Tokyo. Cut like butter and very clean cuts using a fine blade!
