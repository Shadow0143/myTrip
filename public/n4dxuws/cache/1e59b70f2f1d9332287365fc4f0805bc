With the Camera Slings smaller size and shallower depth compared to its bigger siblings, this fabric does a good job keeping things visible. Just because a bag is listed as carry-on compliant here doesn't mean that the airline will interpret it that way. Seller assumes all responsibility for this listing. If you are rolling with accessories like extra cables, smaller action cameras, power banks, ND filters, etc. However, unlike the Camera Backpack, this one isnt removable, nor is there a fancy ladder system involved. the Tech Organizer will help you keep everything together as you see fit. This should be used as a guideline rather than a rule. The three new McKinnon offerings are the 25L Camera Backpack, an 8L Camera Sling, and the Camera Tech Organizer. It attaches to the main strap and to the bottom part of the sling itself via gatekeeper-style clips. In partnership with the professional photographer Peter McKinnon, theres the rather large 35-liter McKinnon Camera Pack and, for those looking for something easier to wield, the smaller 25-liter McKinnon Camera Backpack. Never purchase bad gear again. Copyright  1995-2022 eBay Inc. All Rights Reserved. The largest of these is a zippered pocket with a semi-see-through material. Its a simple but useful feature that reaffirms the thought and photography experience that went into this slings development. This amount includes applicable customs duties, taxes, brokerage and other fees. In the front half is an assortment of different-sized pockets. We dig the nice and subtle touches NOMATIC has put into the Camera Sling to make it photography-focused. Our pre-production sample here came with one of these straps, and you can use it as a stabilizer. The Camera Sling looks like what would happen if you took the 25L Camera Backpack and compressed it. Design-wise the bag has a little bit of a learning curve as there are just so many pockets and ways to maximize its functionality. This bag can meet the needs of everyone.
