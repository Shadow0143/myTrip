Mice running on AA or AAA batteries are usually cheaper than their rechargeable rivals, and batteries are easy to find if you run out unexpectedly and often last longer than the built-in batteries in most mice. That makes plugging in the charging cable easier and also introduces fast charging. Thats a bit odd given how small the mouse is, and it doesnt help that palm grip users dont have much of a body to rest their palms on. But if youre interested in trying out a vertical mouse, the Logitech MX Vertical is the gold standard. It comes with an optical sensor, eight remappable buttons, and up to two years of battery life with a single AA battery. If something goes wrong with the mouse, you can take advantage of its three-year warranty. In practice, it works almost flawlessly, plus you can add a Logitech keyboard into the mix if you have one. However, one of the Logitech MX Master 2S's best features is multidevice support. And once you do, your wrists will thank you. If you were hoping to use this mouse to moonlight in games, think again. Why you should buy it: This mouse does everything well and is our favorite pick. Despite this, its got a strong luxury feel thanks to the comfortable and stylish cork side finish, and it also captures most of the MX Verticals strengths. Its not a huge savings, especially since the purported battery life is 18 months long, but youll more easily be able to recharge this mouse by digging through your junk drawer. Depending on what devices you have in your ecosystem, you may have to carry yet another cable just to charge your wireless mouse for travel. However, you may want a bigger mouse with a more ergonomic design if you need a tool for use at your desk. I can see avoiding this becoming easier with time, but whats worse is that, instead of a scroll wheel, this mouse wants you to flick your finger to scroll. Rather than being in the divot where your thumb rests, like on the MX vertical, the side buttons here instead rest on the mouses top edge. When it comes to input, latency is a measurement of lag. It's also a comfortable mouse regardless of your dominant hand, with two customizable thumb buttons on either side. If youre traveling, you may want to choose a lightweight and compact mouse that can easily slip into a travel bag. The greater the DPI, the higher the sensitivity. Because of its comfort, style and easy portability, I can see some people loving this mouse, either as their main pointer or as a backup when travelling. Its a more hack-y solution, and requires you to turn the mouse over every time you want to swap devices rather than using an easy side button, but it does take away one of the Triathlons unique strengths. The mouse is small, which might be uncomfortable depending on the size of your hand, and you can't use it while it's charging.  Doesn't the G-Pro wireless now have the 25K sensor? The 2S even is better in a few areas, with a higher polling rate and slightly lower latency. Most of these issues, aside from the mouse not being well-suited to games, are easy enough to fix with practice. New York, This results in stilted scrolling that requires a lot of extraneous flicks, even on the highest sensitivity setting. The 500mAh fast-charging battery lasts up to 70 days, so you won't need to worry about running out of juice. It also carries over some of the benefits of the Modern Mobile Mouse, including its uncomplicated and lightweight body, stylish look, many color options and easy portability (it can bend flat to fit into bags with no issue). It's slightly more expensive, but the mouse enjoys a 25,600-DPI sensor and wireless charging through the Logitech Powerplay charging mouse pad. Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Magnetic scroll wheel switches from smooth to ratchet, Control and share data across up to 3 PCs, 4 buttons prograbbale with per-app profiles, Silent switches and dual-functioning scroll wheel with four-way click, 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connectivity options, Other mice can also swap between multiple devices, We check over 250 million products every day for the best prices. Who is it for: People who need a full-size mouse that's comfortable. At 78 grams with batteries installed, its easy to carry around with you and push around a table. The whole chassis is a soft rubber with vertical lines running through for a finish thats very similar to the Logitech MX Master 3 above. Who is it for: A gamer who needs a mouse that's good for long gaming sessions but also has customizable buttons. Why you should buy it: This mouse is one of the slimmest you can buy and is streamlined and elegant. Rechargeable internal batteries are not only better for the environment, as they result in less waste, but they can save you money in the long run since you wont have to keep buying new batteries. Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks. Its got one extra button hidden away in its left thumb rest, which itself is more prominent than the thumb rest on the M510, plus a switch hidden under the scroll wheel that swaps it between ratcheted and smooth scrolling. Logitech MX Master 3Ss scroll wheel is one of its most impressive features, letting you toggle between a smooth or a ratcheted feel with either the press of a button, or automatically based on how fast you spin it. At the same time, its sleek rectangular exterior makes it difficult for certain grip types to handle it, and it doesnt come with extra buttons or too much configurability. The MX Vertical's design is a level above any of its competitors with a look that resembles a sculpted piece of cloud, perfectly molded to fit your hand. It feels great in the hands, so much so that it actually convinced me to abandon my usual claw grip for a palm grip instead, but its hair trigger button that doesnt physically distinguish between left and right click zones and its lack of a scroll wheel means that its not for everyone. Bluetooth does come with a higher risk of perceptible lag, though. Youll have to strain your thumb to reach them, which hurts this devices otherwise strong ergonomics. What even is a best mouse, anyway? Meanwhile, its comfy, ambidextrous body should fit nicely into most hands and its two side buttons are accessible across palm, claw and fingertip grip styles. Logitech is one manufacturer that uses its own adapter, though many of the companys products give you the option to switch between Bluetooth or using its proprietary adapter. It also supports Bluetooth, but you shouldn't need to use it. What we thought of the Logitech G Pro Wireless: Logitech has a lot more competition in the gaming peripheral space than some of its other markets, but that doesn't mean it's not at the top of its game in this space. Heres why you can trust us. Just lay your hand on your mouse once, and youre all set for eight hours straight without needing to move it again (aside from getting up to go to the bathroom). What we thought of the Microsoft Surface Mouse: Although it targets Surface owners who want a little more functionality than the standard touchpad, the Surface Mouse is equally capable on any system you choose. If you don't like the default button mapping, the G Pro Wireless supports Logitech's free desktop software so you can remap any of the peripheral's eight buttons. Smaller mice are optimized for the fingertip grip, where you grab the mouse with your fingertips and move it, while mice with a narrow design are used using a claw grip, where the palm rests on the rear of the mouse and the finger rest on the top of the mouse. This lets you copy and paste images and files easily, or even just use a laptop as a secondary or tertiary monitor without hassle. It's just a shame its price is so notably higher. The 3S combines a comfortable, sculpted design with helpful features such as an electromagnetic scroll wheel, a separate thumb wheel, and a ton of customization options. Its comfortable, has excellent battery life, and comes with simultaneous multidevice support. Please correct me if i am wrong. The Logitech MX Master 3 is an updated version of the 2S version we recommend as our top pick. More advanced mice will allow you to adjust the DPI, sensitivity, and pointer acceleration through software, and these settings are often found in the Control Panel on your PC or in a bespoke application. You can extend the life of your MX Master 3 by three hours with a one-minute charge. Its not a new approach, but at $50 and with 2.4GHz and Bluetooth support, the Ergo M575 is more advanced than what you would have gotten in the 90s. And the right and left click buttons have quiet switches which will be barely audible to your coworkers or housemates. Although the Viper Ultimate is built for gamers, Razer offers the mouse in a few different colors, and you can turn off the RGB lighting through the Razer Synapse software. Enter the Razer Pro Click Mini. Why can't weights and measurements be in international units? Once you learn how to use the Magic Mouse, it feels like second nature. There are other trackball mice on the market, but it's difficult to find one that beats the Kensington Expert. The Razer Viper Ultimate is undoubtedly a wireless gaming mouse, fit with a 20,000-DPI sensor and weighing just 74 grams. Why trust us? The Microsoft Surface Mouse is not packed with loads of extra features, but that's the point of a minimalistic mouse! Who is it for: Anyone who is traveling or anyone who is short on space. But its functions are limited, and its not the most comfortable for all types of users. Plus, its got 5 onboard memory profiles and you can remap buttons, including the 4-way tilt wheel with both infinite and ratcheted scrolling, in Razer Synapse. But after 33 hours using the MX Vertical via Bluetooth with occasional Flow usage, the mouses battery meter had yet to lose one of its bars. Laser mice offer more versatility and can work on a number of different surfaces that prove challenging for LED mice. There are two types of trackball mice: Mice that put the trackball on the side and mice that put it in the center. Michelle Ehrhardt is an editor at Tom's Hardware. Its ergonomic shape makes it supremely comfortable in our long gaming tests, and thanks to tweaks to its overall shape, there's no accumulation of dirt and grime over time. Tom's Hardware is supported by its audience. More importantly, KensingtonWorks allows you to customize the trackball sensitivity. That scroll wheel is both durable and fast, although you also can click the wheel to enter a click-to-click mode for more precise work. But only one of the best wireless mice will also track well, feel comfortable and intuitive in your hand for hours, maintain long battery life and help you get work done. Logitech Flow is a unique piece of software that allows the Triathlon to easily treat multiple computers like one desktop simply by moving the cursor between their displays. The MX Vertical stands above rivals as the best wireless ergonomic mouse, and its not only about its shape. Its no frills design makes it one of the most inexpensive mice on this list at $20, while its 2.4 GHz connectivity keeps it lagless. But with a purported 465 hours of 2.4GHz battery life and 725 hours of Bluetooth battery life, its easy to just stuff this in your bag and forget about it for months on end. What we thought of Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 1850: The Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 1850 is an economical, no-frills mouse. For work, meanwhile, you may want multi-device control and/or the option for Bluetooth so that you can connect with multiple devices without a USB dongle. You can remap your basic right and left clicks but also customize some buttons to trigger macros or act as media keys. Its a bit of a shame that it uses AA batteries instead of being rechargeable, then, especially since those batteries do make it a touch heavier. The more recent Magic Mouse 2 is available with the classic silver color scheme, fit with a white top shell. Even Logitech only claims a 10% reduction in muscle strain. It's a software/hardware hybrid feature, allowing you to not only move the mouse between screens, but also move text, images, and files across them. While laser mice are more accurate, they can be over-sensitive in certain environments.
