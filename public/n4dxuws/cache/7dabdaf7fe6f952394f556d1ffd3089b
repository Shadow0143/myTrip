If you want an Ambassador to ring out a little less, the coated version can help a little. amzn_assoc_ad_mode = "manual"; Attack is important, because it can help your drums either blend into the overall sound (this is important when youre playing in a band or in the studio), or allow your drums to really stand out against all the other instruments (so you can be heard in really loud environments). If you dont care about low-volume drumming or ghost notes, then you can safely choose either the Ambassador or Emperor. amzn_assoc_region = "US"; These drumheads sound very similar to the regular clear Emperor heads. So if youre looking to reduce your overtones or lessen your sustain, the Remo Emperor is the better choice. Compared to all other heads out there, its still within balanced territory though: The Emperor is has a balanced-warm sound, but there are definitely much warmer heads available (like these ones). Okay, heres a quick overview of the differences between Remo Ambassador vs Remo Emperor. You definately do NOT want two ply or muffled heads on the bottom, asthey will seriously kill projection and body.---------------------------------------------------------------Dan Radindir@aol.comMason Gross School of the Arts, Rutgers University, >I'm looking for a punchy tom sound with snappy attackand none of>the heads I've used have ever given it to me.>, >I don't need the durability of a 2-ply head if>that's of any import.>. amzn_assoc_ad_mode = "manual"; Need Some New Drumming Ideas or Inspiration? If you want a slightly deeper drum tone without too much harsher high-pitch frequencies, then the Remo Emperor is a good choice compared to the Ambassador. Overall both the Ambassador and Emperor are extremely well-made professional-grade drumheads, and they can both handle a lot of drumming. He tried ambassadors and that's pretty much what G1's are. amzn_assoc_ad_mode = "manual"; The Ambassadors responsiveness will also mean youll get a fuller tone even when playing softer (since it takes less force to fully activate the drumhead). One is a thinner single-ply head, while the other is a two-ply thicker head with a very different sound. Its super important to remember these differences in ply and thickness, because this is what determines how your drums will actually sound when you choose either the Remo Ambassador or Emperor. All other review and written content is copyright DrumheadAuthority.com. They're just dead--no attack to speak ofand itdoesn't help that they're about 4+ years old! Thats a very loose and general rule though; you can definitely use Ambassadors for those music styles if you prefer the sound (theres never any best drumhead, since it all comes down to your own personal taste). Similarly, if youre worried about the Emperor being a little too warm, get the clear version. amzn_assoc_search_bar = "true"; The key difference between Ambassador vs Emperor drumheads is how theyre built. amzn_assoc_title = " "; Compared to the Remo Emperor, the single-ply Ambassador can produce more sustain and overtones. Check out his other awesome work. That is a definite problem! Lets take a look at the Emperor first. amzn_assoc_title = " "; One final (and important) point to cover is that both the Remo Ambassador and Emperor come in clear and coated versions. The Ambassador is definitely not a super-thin drumhead, and it can handle a bit of hard playing. The original heads were coated> ambassadorswhich weren't to my liking either. Currently, I have> Yamaha clear single ply batter heads (coated ambassadors on the> resonant side). This allows for more sustain, and also more overtones. amzn_assoc_placement = "adunit0"; This sound ranges from bright (or high-pitch) to warm (or dark / low-pitch). The attack of a drumhead is the big crack, snap, or thud you hear when the head is first hit. But the construction is the same when it comes to thickness and ply count, and the sound differences between a G1 and G2 (or between a Classic Clear and Response 2) are very similar to the differences between an Ambassador and an Emperor. If you think back to what we covered earlier, youll know pretty quickly that the Remo Emperor is more durable than the Ambassador, because its thicker (the Emperor is 14mil thick, compared to the 10mil Ambassador). This means that if you want your drums to ring out longer, the Ambassador is the best choice. I'm looking for a punchy tom sound with snappy attackand none ofthe heads I've used have ever given it to me. Could a kind soul with experience with both heads lend some insight?FWIW, the style ofmusic I play is a mix of rock (nothing to heavy), classic rock, andtiny amount of jazz. Its determined by how thick the head is, which becomes pretty clear when you think about it: A thicker film of plastic can take more of a beating compared to a thin film. amzn_assoc_marketplace = "amazon"; Sure, they're a buckor two more than Pinstripes, but they KILL, especially when tuned low. If you dont want to buy via those links, thats fine too: Go support your local independent music store if they deserve it! Thinner and single-ply drumheads are always more responsive than thicker and two-ply heads. amzn_assoc_ad_type = "smart"; > > A jazz drummer around here that I know  (he's probably about 45-50) has an> >> old Ludwig kit that is about 30-40 years old (I think) and he still has> >> the ORIGINAL (ludwig made) skins on his toms! As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. Header photo: Dan Aponte. This is because the thinner material takes less energy to activate and vibrate (which creates your drum sound). Brighter (higher-pitch) drums can be heard more clearly, compared to deep and warm sounding drums. The Remo Emperor is in the sweet spot where its thick enough for a good strong attack, but not too thick. So lets see what this means for the Remo Ambassador and Emperor. *****************************************My only pleasure is to hear you cry.I love to see you cry.I love to see you die.I'll be the first to watch your funeral.And I'll be the last to leave.-Mercyful Fate, Rich '99 SL1*****************************************, >>I'm looking for a punchy tom sound with snappy attackand none of>>the heads I've used have ever given it to me.>, >Strat turned me onto Aquarian Response 2's for my toms.

Its important to think about how your drums will fit into the mix with other instruments here, so give some consideration to the type of attack you need for the style of music you play. amzn_assoc_region = "US"; > A jazz drummer around here that I know  (he's probably about 45-50) has an> old Ludwig kit that is about 30-40 years old (I think) and he still has> the ORIGINAL (ludwig made) skins on his toms! Especially when youre looking beyond comparing Remo Ambassador to Emperor, and across different drumhead brands. amzn_assoc_ad_mode = "manual"; amzn_assoc_title = " "; amzn_assoc_region = "US"; Tip: If youre interested in the different color drumheads available, check out our comparison of the different options  we compare Evans Hydraulic and all of the Remo Colortone varieties. amzn_assoc_tracking_id = "drumheadautho-20"; When comparing the Remo Ambassador vs the Remo Emperor, its mainly the ply count which matters most for sustain and overtones. If you want to get as much sustain as possible from a Remo Emperor drumhead, get the clear version (so the coating doesnt take the edge off your sustain). If a loud attack in your drum sound is important, youd want to consider buying the Remo Emperor rather than the Ambassador. This means that if youre playing quieter music, or if you use a lot of light ghost notes in your drumming, the Remo Ambassador is the best choice compared to the Emperor. amzn_assoc_marketplace = "amazon"; As well as thinking about your tom sound, the same questions can be applied to your snare, or your bass drum. For beginner drummers, overtones can often cause drums to sound strange (with a weird and unpleasant ringing). But a thicker head will always sound a little warmer and deeper, when compared to a thinner head tuned to the exact same tension. I've>got CS's on the bottom, and the combination on my traditional sized Rogers>toms is damn close to my "dream" sound. If youre not beating the hell out of your drums, then I really wouldnt worry about which head is more durable. This is not a huge difference, but it is noticeable if you put these drumheads side by side. amzn_assoc_title = " "; The overall drum sound were talking about here is the balance (or ratio) of tones that these drumheads produce, when compared against each other. So how does attack compare when looking at the Remo Ambassador vs Emperor? Currently, I have> > Yamaha clear single ply batter heads (coated ambassadors on the> > resonant side). That is a definite problem! In the past I've used Evans> Hydraulics (this ws back when I was trying to become Neil Peart in the> early 80's) which were horrible. This coating can have a big impact on your drum sound: Because you can use this knowledge to modify the other variables weve covered above. Its the big sound that comes right when the stick (or your bass drum beater) makes contact with the head, before you hear the ringing of the sustain and overtones. If theres a fairly even amount of both high and low-pitch tones, the heads sound is considered balanced. However, FINDING them is the hard>part :), Gee, that sounds an *awful* lot like my tom setup.

Based on how the thickness and ply can affect responsiveness, hopefully its pretty clear that the Remo Ambassador is more responsive compared to the Remo Emperor. amzn_assoc_region = "US"; Throughout the rest of this review, well be referring back to the differences in thickness and ply count. amzn_assoc_asins = "B079Y9GM8N,B00MBE14Y4,B0011FUI64,B0002GFPNE"; If each tension rod is tuned differently, youll get a lot of strange overtones. amzn_assoc_tracking_id = "drumheadautho-20"; Whats the difference between Remo Ambassador vs Remo Emperor drumheads?

Otherwise, youll risk those ghost notes getting lost (especially when your drums are competing against other instruments). amzn_assoc_marketplace = "amazon"; In general, the Remo Ambassador has a balanced to bright overall sound (when compared to all other drumheads out there). amzn_assoc_tracking_id = "drumheadautho-20"; However, read the next section about clear and coated drumheads, because theres more to brightness and warmth than just head thickness. When hit hard, the Emperor can cut through louder. Check it out, and then well get into exactly what each difference actually means for your drum sound. amzn_assoc_marketplace = "amazon"; amzn_assoc_region = "US"; drumheads with built-in control rings). This affects all of the other variables, so its important to cover this first. While this will obviously affect the tone you get from your drums, it also affects how easily your drums can cut through and be heard (especially in louder environments). So keep this in mind when youre thinking of these heads and reading everything we cover below. Youve got some weight, experience, and power.
