High suction superheatcommon system conditions that cause increased suction temperatures are high TEV superheat settings, ineffective or missing insulation and restricted TEVs. The first thing to realize is that when a system is off and equalized, the systems pressures on both the high side and the low-pressure side will match. If the recovery bottle has air in it, the pressure may be higher than the pressure on the liquid line of a running system. If you have doubt about your HVAC system, kindly contact me to seek clarification. If you want to learn the full Total Superheat Charging Method, check out this article! If a new    R-410A refrigerant bottle had a surrounding air temperature of 75F, the pressure inside the bottle would be 217 PSIG. Below you will find two charts: 410A chart for degrees Fahrenheit (F) and 410A chart for degrees Celsius (C). Hence, the surface temperature of the cooling coil will also be about 14C which is very close to the dew point of air at dry bulb 25C and RH 55% which is 16C. Standard DOT recovery cylinders rated for 350 psi should not be used. Check them out if you're looking to buy one. On the other hand, the temperature of the R410A refrigerant is at 14C when the low side pressure is at 160 psi. The R410A PT chart can be used to answer questions like: What are normal operating pressures for 410A? endobj However, during hot days plus a few months later where the mini split got a bit dirty, the poor brazing point may give off due to the higher working pressure. Air Purifier Room Size Calculator: What Size Air Purifier Do You Need? The limit of the pressure test is depending on the type and size of copper pipes you use for the mini split. Also, the liquid pressure will be dependent on the SEER rating, fin condition, shading, and outdoor airflow. Here is the full 410A PT chart for a liquid state (after the chart, you can also find useful R410A PT examples and graphs): You can see that this R410A pressure chart includes high and low side pressures at temperatures ranging from -60 F to 155 F. R-22 and R-410A Operating Pressures, Charging and Recovery Setup! We can see that at 72F, the R410A pressure is 208,4 psig.
