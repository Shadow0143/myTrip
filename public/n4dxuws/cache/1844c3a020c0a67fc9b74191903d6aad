Hold the spinning gyro ball in your hand, arm outstretched directly in front of you, with your palm facing down. Once the gyroscope inside is going fast enough, a person holding the device can accelerate the spinning mass to high revolution rates by moving the wrist in a circular motion.                                                       wikiHow, Inc. is the copyright holder of this image under U.S. and international copyright laws.

The difference is that a torque is being applied, so one end of the axle is pushing against one side of the groove, while the other end is pushing against the other side.                          x      It doesnt matter which hand you use to hold the cord while you rotate the rotor.     {\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {k} }} There is no minimum or maximum in terms of how far you need to wind the ball up.               r It can also be used as a unique demonstration of some aspects of rotational dynamics.

Most Powerballs have built-in LED lights that light up when the gyroscope is moving. After all, if the axle were shifting in a horizontal groove, the friction on one end that acts to speed up the rotation would be cancelled by the friction at the other end, operating in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the normal and axial forces will have no effect, so tangential force must be provided by friction. The case will hold the cord in place as you rotate your ball and wind it up. wikiHow, Inc. is the copyright holder of this image under U.S. and international copyright laws.                                     Since an acceleration of the rotation will occur regardless of the direction of the applied torque, as long as it is large enough, the device will function without any fine-tuning of the driving motion.                   e      You can hold the Powerball down at your hip or hold it out in front of you while you do this. Get one that fits your palm and feels comfortable to hold.               / This requires a little bit of practice since this process requires the right cadence and speed based on your Powerballs weight and size.

Tip: You do not have to use your Powerball to exercise. You may also alternate the exercise by rotating your hand so your palm is again facing upward, but keep the motion going side to side.
