An 8-channel adapter is available for working in 96 well plates, see No. Although we havent tested models from VacLife or UPFOX, they look extremely similar to other Amazon brands weve tested that were no good. Pet-hair brushes are particularly useful because theyre the most effective tool for that relatively common job. In those cases, we looked at the battery voltage instead.

Youll need to be diligent about knocking the dust loose because if the bin gets too dirty, the suction drops off. An extendable hose can take some of the weight off, but a model that requires you to hold the main unit in one hand while you use the hose with the other might be inconvenient for some people. As with all our picks, the Pivots filter is washable, and regular cleaning will ensure that the vacuum maintains its suction.

The Shark WandVac had better suction and was easier to charge than the mini Bissell and Eufy, but we still didnt find it worth recommending. Thanks to the lithium-ion battery, it maintains steady power throughout the charge cycle. As for the hand vacuums that plug into the AC port in a car, well, a car battery supplies only 12 volts, so those vacs are much, much weaker than any of the models we recommend. Like most handheld vacuums, the Pivot has a flap in the dust bin to prevent debris from falling back out of the vacuum through the nozzle. One of our long-term testers keeps their CHV1410L upright on the floor, and its sturdy enough that the bounding and capering of their energetic dog doesnt knock it over. A few Amazon reviewers point out that the nozzle and built-in crevice tool could be thinner and a little longer to get into cramped areas, such as under car seats, more easily. no need for a dedicated position in the laboratory to perform the aspirator. We measured 82.1 dBc, which is lower than what we got from the Pivot, but its frequency peak registers in the range to which human hearing is most sensitive, so it may be more annoying than our top picks. The Black+Decker 20V Max Lithium Flex BDH2020FL is the best example of this type and has different strengths and weaknesses. Most are also conveniently battery-powered. If weight is a concern, you may prefer the Black+Decker Dustbuster (2.6 pounds), or the Flex, whose main body you can set down so that you can use the hose one-handed. Too often, vacuum owners decide their machine is broken when in reality, a simple cleaning can get it back in working order. Handheld vacuums are also convenient for quick cleanups around the house because theyre compact enough to sit on a shelf or countertop between uses. Unlike the other mini handhelds, it could hold larger debris, but it also struggled to pick up flour. We do recommend two great shop vacs that are better for more heavy-duty jobs, and we may review this category in the future. A pressure-sensitive button on the top of the unit controls the specific amount of vacuum applied. The,      The use of an aspirator is preferential to using a generic laboratory vacuum line as it restricts the possibility of contamination and can be used exactly where the operator is located i.e. Like most handheld vacuums, it has a combo tool with bristles that can help grab clingy particles, as well as a crevice tool to reach into nooks such as the storage compartments built into car doors or the tight areas around car seats. Its gun-shaped body is back-heavy and awkward to handle. Weight is not the only consideration; how the weight is distributed matters, too. The best reason to buy a good hand vacuum is that it can reach places that bigger vacuums cant (or at least not conveniently). The Eufy and Bissell look nearly identical, but during our testing, the Eufy clearly had stronger suction than the Bissell. In addition, this vac has a rubber-nubbed pet-hair attachmentnot a motorized brush as with the Dysonthat gets the job done and doesnt require maintenance. The Black+Decker 20V Max Lithium Flex makes it easy to clean tight spots in your home or car that other hand vacuums struggle with, thanks to its attached hose and tools. NiCd batteries are particularly awful because such vacs start to lose suction about halfway through their run time, they completely lose their charge after a couple of months, and they suffer from the memory effect. In our most basic cleaning test, we made small piles of different types of debris (flour, baking soda, sand, Cheerios, and potato chips) on a flat, smooth surface (like a typical kitchen floor) and then noted how easily each vacuum could pick them up. Still, that should be enough time for you to clean most of the interior of a car, and the strong suction means you can work faster than youd be able to with a weaker model. This is an 8-channel adapter that fits on the Costar Aspirator (No. Both use a flimsy Micro-USB charger, so you cant just plop them in a charging dock. If you need to clean hard-to-reach spots in your car, the Black+Decker 20V Max Lithium Flex BDH2020FL is a great option because of its extendable hose and useful tools. Again, higher battery voltage doesnt necessarily mean more cleaning power, but weve found that 16volts is a reasonable baseline for decent suction. The main downside, as with most Dustbuster-style models, is that the CHV1410L cant clean upholstery very effectively. Debris (especially hair) tends to cling to fabric, and the CHV1410L has neither the suction nor the right tools to offset that clinginess. The Flex comes with three attachments that clip onto the end of the hose (top to bottom): a combo brush, a crevice tool, and a pet-hair brush. The most common examples are the interior of a car and surfaces around your house that arent the floor, such as countertops, windowsills, curtains, and shelves.
