From a reliability and cost-effectiveness standpoint, both pumps have very good service lives. The following errors occurred with your submission. Mufflers, now mandatory at a great many tracks in the country, can render this system ineffective as even minor backpressure from the exhaust system will drop the pumping efficiencies to almost zero. The BBR needed additional crankcase evac under WOT. At the conclusion of drag testing, the difference in e.t. In addition to a clean engine compartment, there was no oil to be found on the bottom of the transmission pan, and the rear main seal was perfectly dry. Follow along as we install and test both the Butler Performance standard and Moroso-based Evac Pump Kits. This page was generated at 07:55 PM. Some oil mist inside the engine is critical to ensure proper lubrication of the parts that don't have direct oil flow such as the wristpins. Thanks for the info. Maybe you could use a "boost a pump" to run it at a higher voltage if it would handle it. Not so much for HP, but for leak prevention under high boost. LONG, Getting Out of the LT1 Game - LT1 Engine Parts. You have to pry up on the bottom tangs to get it to pop off the aluminum housing. 	Privacy Statement - I read on the web about turbo Buick guys using a electric smog pump as an evac pump. Don't see another board for your problem? 	Terms of Service - Powered by a '71 455 with round-port H.O. Intake duties are handled by an Edelbrock Victor manifold and Holley 950 DP carburetor before dumping exhaust out of a set of Hooker headers. Not legal in Stock Eliminator, last time I checked. I've been told the early Northstar engines have something similar and have been looking for one for a while. 	Manage Preferences -  Advertising - In addition to solving the unsightly oil leaks, by reducing crankshaft pressure the intake manifold charge isn't contaminated with oil, and the additional ring seal consistently produces measurable horsepower gains. For hot street cars and drag racers, a Butler Evac Pump Kit might just be the cure for your pressurized oiling blues. On the electric smog pump setups they don't pull much vacum. They also don't like the fumes/crud pulled from the crankcase and have a tendency to fail. Of course, there are downsides. Is your car making a strange sound or won't start? I think so. Header/collector systems work well on open-headered cars but generally only pull about 1-2 inches of vacuum from a race engine. Dyno TestingTesting of the '65 GTO was performed at Real Performance Motorsports in Lewisville, Texas. Electrical vacuum pumps are available and easy to install but can't pump enough volume to produce more than 2-3 inches of vacuum. At idle, the car registered 0 inches of vacuum being pulled from the engine-not unexpected since the pump was rotating so slowly. George Reaves' (of Whitewright, Texas) '65 GTO is a former "Pontiac Pavement Pounders" participant, and the same combination of parts routinely puts the GTO into the 11.1-second e.t. Id recommend a GZ Motorsports vacuum pump. It will pull harder, especially under boost, and its cheaper and cleaner. From the autoparts store I think the pump was well over 100 dollars. Likely will give an electric a shot. I have heard too much will pull the oil out of the main and rod bearings which I definately am not interested in doing. When operating the motor before I would sometimes hear a loud squeek that I determined was the dry bushing in the motor. About to put the money into one and looking for what works best for most of y'all. The engine is shifted manually at 6,000 rpm and goes through the traps in the quarter-mile at 6,100 rpm. Installation can be accomplished in 1-2 hours with the hardest tasks being where to locate the breather tank and cutting the braided hoses to length. Proper piston-ring seal is paramount to getting the most out of any engine. If that weren't enough, high crankcase pressure also forces oil to evacuate through any seal it can breach. In addition, the back of the driver-side valve cover was wet, and both breathers had oil residue where they mounted to the valve covers. For all the power that they produce, a keen eye must be kept on efficiency as well. I like it so far- 4 months. I''l be running mufflers since will see very occasional street use. I use the header evac system on my car. It obstructs the airflow just being there. I removed it completely. I was going to say that I was concerned that they didn't pull enough volume (only 3"), but now that you've got it over 10", seems like it's a non-problem! Hard starting issue, Chevy 350 small block with Edlebrock Performer Carb. They are super plentiful at the junkyard. Be a do'er and not a shoulda done'er. Other than the ability to stop the pesky oil leaks that plague high-performance engines, the vacuum pumps can and should be used as aids in prolonging piston-ring and cylinder-seal integrity as well as valuable diagnostic equipment. Maybe to minimze hot air draw into the intake charge? So the pump didnt like pushing through the check valve but it pulles okay? '94 Camaro Z-28, Black, 850hp, Blown 396, AFR LT1 LT4 190cc Street Eliminator CNC Heads and Intake. funny thing is , those pumps are the first thing us LT1 guys toss in the trash. JavaScript is disabled. Has anyone used the AIR electric pumps as a boost initiated crank case evacuation pump in conjunction with with a catch can? and 0.11 mph. All times are GMT-8. Very cool - the catch canteen somehow looks a lot less improvised than it sounds. On a typical 500-horse engine, the modified Ford-style pump used in our standard kit generally creates 8-12 hp on an engine dyno while the Moroso pump gains 15-25 hp.". Adding an in-line pump in-series with an in-tank pump? Life is short. Has anyone used the AIR electric pumps as a boost initiated crank case evacuation pump in conjunction with with a catch can? The following errors occurred with your submission. 	Do Not Sell My Personal Information -, By logging into your account, you agree to our. A little while back I started doing research on crankcase evac systems because boost pressure in my crankcase was causing me massive oil leaks out of every mating surface. The GTO's big-cube mill put out 340.7 hp in its baseline configuration. I then applied a small amount of grease to the upper bushing hole in the can. Looking at preferred brand/model and also belt driven vs electric. Adding new relays is a good job. For enthusiasts looking to gain a bit more horsepower and have the ability to rebuild their own pumps, the Moroso three-vane pump is a great choice. Contact Us - Sounds like you may have come up with a newer version! I've run with a 355 at your HP level with only alve cover breathers and no problems. It cost ~$250 for whole set up (pump, catch can, -10an lines & fittings). Anyone used the electric AIR pump as a vacuum pump for Crank case evac? Drag testing was conducted at Redline Raceway in Caddo Mills, Texas. List of 71 original GM 3rd Gen Part Numbers!! I was figuring exhaust evac to do the work out of boost, and let the pump "ramp things up" in boost. It  may not display this or other websites correctly. I dont know how much current that thing will pull and every device I add to my harness (like alky pump) makes me paranoid. Did u remove the cylindrical object on the left with the spring (check valve) completely ? I run a Ford electric vacuum pump. The PCV/electric vacum deal looks interesting for a street driven car. For a better experience, please enable JavaScript in your browser before proceeding. When run on an eighth-mile track, the car is barely able to shift into Third gear before the eighth-mile marker lights are tripped. heads, the 12:1-compression engine uses an Ultradyne roller cam and Harland Sharp 1.65 roller rockers. Thinking of adding power with a new combination? 	 Im guessing it wont want to push through the check valve I have on my exhaust. To eliminate oil leaks on a Pontiac, we like to see between 5 and 10 inches of vacuum with a maximum of 14 inches. and mph between the best runs that were produced by the Moroso pump and the slowest runs without any vacuum pump were at or less than 0.04 in e.t. What u described is what i just installed here: Plumb a vacuum gauge to the valve cover opposite from where the vacuum pump is running and this will give you how much vacuum your system is drawing. Just for humors sake I do remember in HS taking the emission junk off my monte and running a hose from the emission pump into my breather. I have 3 of these electric pumps from our vettes when we removed the AIR system and was just thinking maybe I could put them to good use.. sure would be nice to rig up and have a vacuum/pressure gauge to let me know where the crank case was throughout the operating range.

I decided this was the route I was gonna take, mainly because I got a pump for free. For leaks I just use an air compressor and soapy water. 	Privacy Statement - Hobbyists and pros build race engines to make the most power possible within the constraints of a budget and the design limits of the motor. Have you run your car with a vacuum gauge on your dipstick tube to see what the actual reading is. The addition of a vacuum pump to remove the positive pressure in the crankcase and introduce a few inches of negative pressure (vacuum) can increase power production and improve the seal of the piston rings and all those places where oil used to leak. https://bangshift.com/forum/forum/ba69-galaxie-500, https://bangshift.com/forum/forum/baix-to-4sixzero, http://www.bangshift.com/forum/forum485-bbr-s-83gt, http://www.bangshift.com/forum/forumuck-conversion, https://bangshift.com/forum/forum/batooth-and-nail, http://www.dragstuff.com/techarticles/vacuum-pumps.html. does anyone know how much vacuum is too much or what the ideal negative pressure in the crank case should be when under boost? The 2-wire smog pumps do not have this solenoid so there is nothing to remove. This may be due in part to my file fit ring noobieness or the fact 8 giant pistons moving 4.5" at 6000 rpm are creating some very large crankcase pulsations.  BTW, what voltage does that thing use? I would think this could be a simple thing to build design and could work with a hobbs pressure switch to be turned on as soon as pressure in the intake was above atmo. "For aggressive engine builds that feature long strokes, high cylinder pressures, or elevated rpm potential, an Evac Pump Kit is a great way to stop oil leaks and pick up a few extra horsepower. I am too scared of them at the moment but that sounds like something that would give mental comfort (and make some wires happier). - Patrick Henry. Maximum horsepower was achieved at 5,400 rpm. 	Cookie Policy - "The Constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people, it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government - lest it come to dominate our lives and interests." especially if mounted so the fumes go into the motor. Drag Testing RPM has a Dynojet Model-248C dyno. 	 According to Butler, "By utilizing a dash-mounted vacuum gauge, the enthusiast can carefully monitor the condition of the engine's sealing abilities pass after pass. And old race trick> go to the bone yard and find an old smog pump that will fit. The GeeTO Tiger's standard evac pump lasted for five years before needing replacement. As significant was the fact that the pump completely eliminated the oil leaks that had previously plagued the car on the dyno. You are using an out of date browser. bracket in the quarter with 7.2s in the eighth-mile. If the electric is your only vent when it fails it will offer no engine breathing. So why do all this work when you could just run a hose from the valve cover to the inlet side of the turbo with a separator inline? Due to electrical interference present in the ignition system, rpm was not recorded consistently across all pulls. From an effectiveness standpoint, a belt-driven vacuum pump provides more vacuum to relieve the crankcase pressure, thus eliminating oil leaks and allowing the piston rings to seal better. I've heard the collector evacs aren't a good idea with mufflers. Installation was completed by George Reaves, the owner of the '65 GTO test car at Real Performance Motorsports (RPM) in Lewisville, Texas. ConclusionIt is apparent that both Butler Performance Evac Pump Kits are complete and well designed. Even with just breathers, I would think those fumes should get pushed out the breathers. It will suck the boost pressure dry! Recorded at the same 6,000 rpm in Third gear, the pump generated 9 1/2 inches of vacuum and achieved an outstanding gain of 14.5 hp over the baseline. The pump has to be mounted so that it can be driven off of the crankshaft pulley, bringing into consideration packaging constraints that presently will not allow the factory GM air-conditioning units to remain unless custom brackets are fabricated. At idle, the three-vane Moroso pump pulled 1/2 inch of vacuum. 	Archive - I was getting a drop or 2 of oil out the front and rear seals, but it took care of that. Now that I know other engines may have something that'll work I'm happy! Curious on crankcase evac systems. Redline raceway is an eighth-mile venue, and on this day, it was hosting a bracket series held by the Texas Muscle Car Club Challenge. Whatever the case may be, I decided to use an electric vacuum pump to evac the crankcase. I'll give you my take on them since Stock and Super Stock is limited to a collector probe vacuum evacuation system . In addition, torque is not noted as the torque maximums were always dependent on when the engine was floored and the converter was flashed. I considered using standard header evacs, but man I would rather swallow a box of razors that pull those headers off again. Any performance gains would be a bonus. Vacuum was measured on a sealed system at a valve-cover bung at idle and at 6,000 rpm in Third gear. From what I've read about the exhaust evac you should be getting more vacuum at higher rpm's then at idle. Clean it up good, set it up to run in reverse. You must log in or register to reply here. Once installation was complete, both systems were dyno tested at RPM and then raced at Redline Raceway in Caddo Mills, Texas. 	Manage Preferences -  The water and fuel should be driven out of the oil when the oil gets hot enough - right? With replacement pumps retailing for $99 and the Moroso Rebuild Kit running $105, both systems are relatively inexpensive to maintain." At a maximum rpm of 6,000 in Third gear on the Turbo 400 transmission, the pump pulled 5 inches of vacuum, and the decreased pressure and more effective ring seal allowed horsepower to jump by almost 6. Also, how's it dealing with oil mist going through it? The choice of pumps comes down to the hobbyist's budget and goals. ET drag slicks that measure 10.5x29x15 fill up the wheelwells. Contact Us - Or did u just cut the wires ? Electric Vacuum Pumps For Crankcase Pressure, What's Out There Over 5"? Post it here! The result is pressure on the underside of the piston on the intake and power strokes, which reduces efficiency by offering more resistance to the piston's downward movement in the bore. "By designing custom brackets to fit either a modified Ford-style vacuum pump or a Moroso pump, we've created an easy solution to the issues created by too much crankcase pressure. Once the GTO was unleashed, it was evident that the Evac Pump Kit was performing its job. Once again, the reduction of crankcase pressure kept any oil from escaping the engine. After cleaning the mess and finishing the installation of the standard Butler Evac Pump Kit, a vacuum gauge was connected to the passenger-side valve-cover fitting. It also places more stress on the piston rings, thereby reducing their seal capabilities and increasing the chance of blow-by. There are three common vacuum-pump methodologies on the market today; header/collector aspiration vacuum, electric vacuum pumps, and belt-drive vacuum pumps. Not much, but enough to make me want to find a remedy. It would puke a little oil out the breathers at WOT. .Pumps are not allowed. Need other technical information or engine specific advice? Who has converted Smog pump into vacuum pump? I picked mine up for 15 dollars like I said so I don't think you can go wrong with one from the junkyard. Following a cool down, the Moroso Evac Pump Kit was installed, and the car was back on the dyno for testing. What I have seen is if you have restrictive mufflers a header evac system doesn't work as good. According to David Butler of Butler Performance, "For street vehicles that see routine highway miles or spirited weekend-driving duties, owners should definitely retain the factory PCV valve and standpipe with a breather element to reduce the chance of oil leaks if the use of a vacuum pump is not a viable option. Seems to me less pulleys running off the crank would be a better option, but do the electrics pull enough vacuum? My pump is the top right one. Cut-off wheel or fine-tooth hacksaw blade for cutting stainless braided hoses. I did and that's how I know what my crankcase is doing. As compared to the standard kit, the Moroso kit was able to pull out almost double the volume of pressurized crankcase gases, allowing even better ring seal and elevated horsepower numbers. Although the firewall and valve covers were clean before the run, the pressure that built up in the engine pushed oil out of the dipstick tube, and it dripped onto the passenger-side header. By badandy in forum Engine - Block, Piston, Heads, Intakes, By SebringLX in forum Electrical & Fuel System, By Reaper1 in forum Electrical & Fuel System, http://www.turbobuick.com/forums/gen-pump-how.html, Crankcase evacuation through fuel pump block off plate. As expected, the short eighth-mile distance really didn't highlight the enhanced horsepower that the vacuum pump allows the engine to make, but more importantly, both units proved that they were the solution to stopping the oil leaks that would show up on the car at drag-racing venues. An Art Carr 2,500-stall torque converter sends power through a Turbo-400 transmission and out back to a 3.90-geared Ford 9-inch rearend. What wire are you running it off of. Key Engine Parameters: air-inlet temperature (AIT). Northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, Signature Pictures and PhotoShop Requests, http://web.camaross.com/forums/showtto+vacuum+pump. Idling Sudden Loss of Fuel Pressure No Start, The story of Grandpas 87 Turbo Buick (Full). As George Reaves routinely laces up his spurs as a member of the Dallas Area Pontiac Association, the other member clubs in the Texas Muscle Car Challenge were happy to put aside their brand biases and allow testing at the conclusion of the bracket race. If this is your first visit, be sure to The car was running on drag slicks, which pulls down the rear-wheel horsepower on a chassis dyno compared to street tires. 	Cookie Policy - Since the factory PCV system is not used on most race engines because it's less effective than on a stocker, positive pressure in the crankcase builds as engine rpm is increased. I'm curious, is it a J/Y piece or did you buy it new? 	Terms of Service - 		check out the. If the primary purpose of the pump is to stop any oil leaks, the standard kit will provide reliable service for years. Interesting. lol. On Pontiacs, the rear main seal, valve covers, and oil-dipstick tube are usually the first to seep. Works much better than the expensive electric units and can do for about 25-50 bucks complete.
