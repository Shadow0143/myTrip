Joannes, then flees in the middle of the night with both the diamond and the 45,000 francs. Perhaps no novel within a given number of years had so many readers and penetrated into so many different countries. With the money earned he bought the title of "Count de Morcerf" to bring wealth and a more pleasant life for himself and his family. Ainsworth translated the remaining chapters of the novel, again in abridged form, and issued these in volumes VIII and IX of the magazine in 1845 and 1846 respectively. Bertuccio enters the house to view the crime scene but is discovered by the port authorities, who arrest him for the murders. He became partly paralysed during the second, in which Dants revived him by supplying him with a liquor. Barrois: Old, trusted servant of Monsieur de Noirtier. It centers on a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about exacting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. Picaud was placed under a form of house arrest in the Fenestrelle Fort, where he served as a servant to a rich Italian cleric. [8] Dumas included this essay in one of the editions of his novel published in 1846. Dumas was a member of the Club des Hashischins. [7][Notes 1] The attitude of Dumas towards "bonapartisme" was conflicted. "[19], Modern Russian writer and philologist Vadim Nikolayev determined The Count of Monte-Cristo as a megapolyphonic novel. Madeleine Caderousse, ne Radelle: Wife of Caderousse, who, according to the court, is responsible for the murder of a Jewish jeweller. By manipulating the bond market, Dants then quickly destroys a large portion of Danglars' fortune. The success of The Count of Monte Cristo coincides with France's Second Empire. [9] This story is also mentioned in the Pliade edition of this novel,[7] and it probably served as a model for the chapter of the murders inside the Villefort family. Lupton, translated by Henry L. Williams (this translation was also released by M.J. Ivers in 1892 with Williams using the pseudonym of Professor William Thiese). The first single volume translation in English was an abridged edition with woodcuts published by Geo Pierce in January 1846 entitled The Prisoner of If or The Revenge of Monte Christo. Maximilian Morrel: Son of Pierre Morrel, an army captain who becomes a friend of Dants. There, on the road from Beaucaire to Bellegarde, he decides to make a stop at Caderousse's lodging to shelter. Dants reveals his true identity and explains that he rescued Morrel's father from bankruptcy years earlier; he then tells Maximilien to reconsider his suicide, and Maximilien is saved. After travelling in the East to continue his education (and to plot his revenge), Dants reappears nine years later, in 1838, as the wealthy Count of Monte Cristo, a title he has purchased. 18441846: The story is published in parts in a Parisian magazine. The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is an adventure novel written by French author Alexandre Dumas (pre) completed in 1844. She is the daughter of. After Benedetto and Caderousse are freed by Dants, using the alias "Lord Wilmore," the Count induces Benedetto to take the identity of "Viscount Andrea Cavalcanti" and introduces him into Parisian society. Danglars and Mondego set a trap for Dants. [11] The translation follows the revised French edition of 1846, with the correct spelling of "Cristo" and the extra chapter The House on the Alles de Meilhan. Baptistin: Monte Cristo's valet-de-chambre. Pasha, who is cheated by Fernand, is received among cries of joy. The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 18151839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. Villefort admits his guilt and flees the court. Caderousse names Danglars and Mondego as the men who betrayed him, and also that his father has died of self-inflicted starvation. Grard de Villefort: Chief deputy prosecutor who imprisons Dants, later becoming acquaintances as Dants exacts his revenge. Learning that his old employer Morrel faces bankruptcy, Dants, posing as a clerk of Thomson and French, buys Morrel's debts and gives Morrel three months to fulfil his obligations. Fechter moved to the United States in 1869 and Monte Cristo was chosen for the inaugural play at the opening of the Globe Theatre, Boston in 1870. On learning that Morrel's son Maximilien is in love with Valentine, the Count saves her by making it appear as though Hlose's plan to poison Valentine has succeeded and that Valentine is dead. Albert's friend Beauchamps sends the news article to Albert, who returns to Paris. On the day in 1815 when Napoleon escapes the Island of Elba, Edmond Dants brings the ship Pharaon into dock at Marseille. As a result, the Count of Monte Cristo is usually associated with a coldness and bitterness that comes from an existence based solely on revenge. Realizing that Edmond Dants now intends to let Albert kill him, she reveals the truth to Albert, which causes Albert to make a public apology to the Count. The 2009 Everyman's Library edition reprints the original anonymous English translation that first appeared in 1846, with revisions by Peter Washington and an introduction by Umberto Eco. The telegram sent to the Ministry of Interior states that the pretender to the throne King of Spain exiled at Bourges in 1830, Infante Carlos Mara Isidro of Spain, had returned to Barcelona acclaimed by popular opinion. Crowell updated the translation, correcting mistakes and revising the text to reflect the original serialized version. Madame Hermine Danglars (formerly Baroness Hermine de Nargonne ne de Servieux): Once a widow, she had an affair with Grard de Villefort, a married man. At the end of the three months and with no way to repay his debts, Morrel is about to commit suicide when he learns that his debts have been mysteriously paid and that one of his lost ships has returned with a full cargo, secretly rebuilt and laden by Dants. Selim, who guarded the Pasha's fortune and his wife and daughter, is also deceived and persuaded to turn off the flame in his torch. The ending sees Dants and Mercedes reunited and the character of Haydee is not featured at all. Its influence can also be seen in how one of the first prominent cases of miscarriage of justice in Japan, in which an innocent man was charged with murder and imprisoned for half a century, is known in Japanese as the "Yoshida Gankutsu-ou incident" (). In 1889, two of the major American publishers Little Brown and T.Y. The first translation into Chinese was published in 1907. Dants inquires after the reason for his uneasiness, threatening him unless he explains. He goes bankrupt and is left with only 50,000 francs after stealing 5,000,000 francs. When he is thrown into the sea, Dants cuts through the sack and swims to a nearby island, the Island of Tiboulen, where he is rescued by a Genoese smuggling ship that passes Monte Cristo called Jeune-Amlie (Young Amelia), whose crew allow Dants to join them. During this trip, he promised that cousin of Louis Bonaparte that he would write a novel with the island's name in the title. A motion picture based on Fechter's play, with O'Neill in the title role, was released in 1913 but was not a huge success. In the end, she returns to Marseilles, living in the house that belonged to father Dants, given to her by Monte Cristo himself, praying for Albert, who left France for Africa as a soldier to start a new and more honorable life. In another of the true stories reported by Ashton-Wolfe, Peuchet describes a poisoning in a family. On 28 February 1829, exactly 14 years after Edmond's imprisonment, Faria succumbs to catalepsy after his third attack. To cover up the affair, Villefort told Madame Danglars that the infant was stillborn, smothered the child and attempted to bury him in a box with a piece of linen clothwhich revealed his noble precedence(inscribed with the letters "H" and "N", later revealed as indicating Hermine of Norgonne) in the garden. It debuted in Switzerland in 2009. In 1996, Penguin Classics published a new translation by Robin Buss. He is paralysed and only able to communicate with his eyes, but retains his mental faculties and acts as protector to Valentine. Much more radical was the version by Charles Fechter, a notable French-Anglo actor. During the course of his imprisonment, Faria tells the story of the treasure: In April 1498, Cardinal Cesare Spada ordered the fortune hidden in the Island of Monte Cristo in order to prevent it from being seized by the then Pope Alexander VI and his son Cesare Borgia. Meanwhile, Caderousse blackmails Andrea, threatening to reveal his past if he does not share his newfound wealth. [25][26] Jin Yong has admitted some influence from Dumas, his favorite non-Chinese novelist. Pierre Morrel: Dants' employer, owner of Morrel & Son. Originally, Dumas wrote part of the story, including the events in Rome and the return of Albert de Morcerf and Franz d'pinay to Paris, in the first person from Franz d'pinay's point of view. The first appearance of The Count of Monte Cristo in English was the first part of a serialization by W. Francis Ainsworth in volume VII of Ainsworth's Magazine published in 1845, although this was an abridged summary of the first part of the novel only and was entitled The Prisoner of If. The novel is popular in Japan, and has spawned numerous adaptations, the most notable of which are the novels Meiji Gankutsu-ou by Taijirou Murasame and Shin Gankutsu-ou by Kaitar Hasegawa. Thomas Alexandre Dumas was also known as Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie. Dants told them of the 3,000 francs he had buried there, to start life once he married, before all his misfortunes. In 1955, Collins published an updated version of the anonymous translation which cut several passages, including a whole chapter entitled The Past, and renamed others. Faria reveals he is a priest and scholar with excellent memory, creativity and impressive knowledge. Caderousse then turns to serious crimes of murder, spends time in prison, and ends up being murdered by Andrea Cavalcanti. It is one of the author's more popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. The Count confronts Villefort, revealing his true identity as Dants, which drives Villefort insane. Albert and Mercds disown Fernand and leave his house. Fernand helped frame Edmond (by sending the accusation letter) in an ultimate desperate attempt to not lose Mercds forever. Albert de Morcerf: Son of Mercds and Fernand. 1802: Black officers are dismissed from the army. In addition to the above, there have also been many abridged translations such as an 1892 edition published by F.M. In love with Maximilien Morrel. Valentine is briefly disinherited by Noirtier in an attempt to prevent Valentine's impending marriage with Franz d'pinay, whom she does not love; however, the marriage is cancelled when d'pinay learns from Noirtier that his father, who he believed was assassinated by Bonapartists, was killed by Noirtier in a duel. The introduction to the Pliade edition mentions other sources from real life:  a man named Abb Faria existed, was imprisoned but did not die in prison; he died in 1819 and left no large legacy to anyone. After escaping from their palace, Ali Pasha of Janina, his wife, Vasiliki, his daughter, Hayde, their servant Selim, and a troop of 20 soldiers escort Pasha's family to a fortress. At the time, Napoleon planned to set up a kingdom covering the whole Italian peninsula, notwithstanding, of course, opposition from the neighbouring kingdoms. Dants' neighbour, Caderousse, is present at the meeting; he too is jealous of Dants, although he objects to the plot, but becomes too intoxicated with wine to prevent it. In June 2017, Manga Classics, an imprint of UDON Entertainment, published The Count of Monte Cristo as a faithfully adapted Manga edition of the classic novel.[16]. They had an illegitimate son, Benedetto. Lord Wilmore: An Englishman, and the persona in which Dants performs random acts of generosity. Gaspard Caderousse: Originally a tailor and later the owner of an inn, he was a neighbour and friend of Dants who fails to protect him at the beginning of the story. Sometime later (on Villefort's account, November 1816), Villefort goes back to the Auteuil house in search of the corpse, for he was haunted by the feeling that the babyas he was unable to find the boxmay have survived and, if so, then Bertuccio (whom he doesn't know anything about, except for the fact that he was a Corsican) had kidnapped the baby after stabbing him.  The first, by Hailes Lacy, differs only slightly from Dumas' version with the main change being that Fernand Mondego is killed in a duel with the Count rather than committing suicide. Assunta tracks down the baby's location following the address stated in the linen cloth Bertuccio retrieved from the burial box and takes him home (he gave half of the cloth to Assunta). After going to a trial, Fernand has a defence against the newspaper's story but no defence against Hayde's testimony. In July 1815 Bertuccio encounters Villefort, demanding he intervene and prosecute the killers, but he refuses to do so, stating that "Well, he was smitten with the sword, and he perished by the sword () It is a misfortune, and the government owes nothing to your family". Abb Busoni: The persona of an Italian priest with religious authority. After his service in the French Army, he eventually gains the favour of the restored Bourbon monarchy and ascends with rapidity in the Arme, becoming captain in 1823. His captain, Leclre, had died during the passage; the ship's owner, Morrel, will make Dants the next captain. Day after day, at breakfast or at work or on the street, people talked of little else. Becomes "Andrea Cavalcanti" in Paris. Inside, Bertuccio sees Caderousse negotiating and discussing with a Parisian jeweller, M. Joannes, for the sale of the diamond bestowed by Dants during his visit as the Abb Busoni. Despite screaming in agony and trying to escape, she dies from her wounds. The novel, falsely attributed to Dumas, but in fact, originally published anonymously or sometimes attributed to one F. Le Prince, has been traced to Portuguese writer Alfredo Possolo Hogan[es].[31][32]. The Count first rewards Caderousse with a valuable diamond. Six days later, the ship returns and he boards, carrying a few carefully hidden diamonds with him. The jeweller offers Caderousse a sum of 40, and then 45,000 francs for the diamond, but Carderouse demands to be paid the sum estimated by the Abb (50,000 francs), which the jeweller rejects, not only telling him that he will not buy it for that price, but also threatening to report him to the authorities if he refuses to sell it to him at the price he requested, for the story of its acquisition sounds highly unlikely. Monsieur d'Avrigny: Family doctor treating the Villefort family. As the story opens, the character Dants is not aware of the politics, considers himself simply a good French citizen, and is caught between the conflicting loyalties of the royalist Villefort during the Restoration, and the father of Villefort, Noirtier, loyal to Napoleon, a firm bonapartist, and the bonapartist loyalty of his late captain, in a period of rapid changes of government in France.
