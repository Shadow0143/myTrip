Love the continues marble look as a countertop and chevron backsplash in this kitchen! The bathroom are tiled with hex marble tile on the floor and herringbone marble tiles in the shower. What a gorgeous chevron backsplash with the silver shinning stripes that goes perfect with the countertop!We love the idea of backsplash that goes all the way up.
