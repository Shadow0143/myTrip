You can also use REVERT Total Protein Stain to stain membranes post-transfer to monitor transfer efficiency. Sign up for emails and youll get exclusive application notes, protocols, tips on improving data quality, and more. Reduce signal by reducing the amount of protein loaded or the amount of antibody. Your data will not be quantitative if you incubate multiple membranes together in one container. For the Odyssey CLx, and Odyssey Classic Imaging Systems, clean the glass surface with an alcohol-based cleaner before imaging. Decrease Tween 20 in diluted antibodies. Box 4425 Dont use milk for blocking, as milk typically contains IgGs that cross-react with anti-goat secondary antibodies. First, you will need to accept cookies. For PVDF membranes, recommended SDS concentration is 0.01  0.02% during the secondary antibody incubation step (in addition to Tween 20).                 document.write(new Date().getFullYear()); Because the species are so closely related, anti-mouse will react with rat IgG to some extent, and anti-rat with mouse IgG. Make sure that 0.1  0.2% Tween 20 is present in buffer. For IRDye Secondary Antibodies, dilute between 1:10,000  1:40,000. Use secondary antibodies from the same host species to avoid potential cross-reactivity. The amount of methanol in the transfer buffer, timing of gel presoak, choice of membrane, voltage, and length of transfer can all change how much protein transfers to the membrane. Always handle membranes carefully and with clean forceps. Your primary antibody may work much better with a different blocking buffer. The blocker you use may affect background bands. For data examples and troubleshooting tips, see the Good Westerns Gone Bad technical note. Recommended Tween 20 concentration is 0.1  0.2%. Then place the membrane in blocking. Detect the two secondary antibodies on two separate blots first.                  LI-COR, Inc. For tips on how to choose an appropriate blocker, get the Western Blot Blocker Optimization for Near-Infrared Detection protocol. You can also use the narrowest possible well size to concentrate antigen. To get complete transfer of larger proteins, extend transfer times. After transfer is complete, dry your membrane before you block. Do not reuse antibody. Loading too little or loading too much protein sample will decrease antibody sensitivity. The best transfer conditions, membrane, and blocker for experiments depend on your antigens and antibodies. Applications > Troubleshooting for Quantitative Western Blots. Primary antibody may have low affinity for your target. Pre-wetting is necessary to help the PBS or TBS interact with the membrane, because PVDF membranes are very hydrophobic. Extend primary antibody incubation time. A good starting dilution is 1:20,000. Looking to chat with support? For PVDF membranes, add or increase SDS in diluted secondary antibodies. Get the One-Blot Western Optimization: Using the MPX Blotting System technical note for more information. Blocking solutions containing BSA may cause high membrane background and nonspecific antibody binding for near-infrared Western blots. Use the suppliers lowest recommended amount of antibody. Try the MPX Blotting System to optimize antibody concentration. Avoid using mouse and rat primary antibodies together if possible. Optimize to determine the best blocking buffer for your primary antibody. Add Tween 20 to primary, secondary, and wash steps at 0.1  0.2%. With IRDye 680LT Secondary Antibodies, use SDS (0.01  0.02% final concentration) and Tween 20 (0.1  0.2% final concentration) during the detection incubation step. For details, get the One-Blot Western Optimization: Using the MPX Blotting System technical note. If using PVDF, pre-wet the membrane in 100% methanol until it becomes translucent gray instead of opaque white. Wet tank transfer is the gold standard for protein transfer. Use the MPX Blotting System to optimize primary and secondary antibody dilutions. IRDye Secondary Antibodies are stable for 3 months at 4 C. After 3 months, the effectiveness of secondary antibodies will decrease, and background may increase. Clean forceps with methanol before using or after dipping them into an antibody solution (especially dye-labeled secondary antibody). Use less secondary antibody to minimize cross-reactivity  a good starting dilution is 1:20,000.                                     Lincoln, NE 68504-0425 For the best experimental replicability, block membranes at consistent times and temperatures. For nitrocellulose membranes, you can also use an Odyssey Pen. One-Blot Western Optimization: Using the MPX Blotting System, Western Blot Blocker Optimization for Near-Infrared Detection. SDS in transfer buffer may interfere with binding of transferred proteins, especially for low molecular weight proteins. A pre-stained molecular weight marker can help you monitor transfer. Extended blocking times can mask antigen and decrease signal intensities. This helps you determine the best signal with the lowest amount of antigen. For tips on how to choose an appropriate blocker, get the Western Blot Blocker Optimization for Near-Infrared Detection protocol. Determine the optimal loading concentration by performing a serial dilution of your target of interest. Check transfer buffer choice and blotting procedure. Increase antibody volume so entire membrane surface is sufficiently covered with liquid at all times. Use enough reagents to prevent areas of the membrane from drying out during incubations and washes. If signal in one channel is very strong (near or at saturation), it may cause signal in one channel to bleed to the other channel. Try reducing or eliminating SDS. Use low-fluorescence PVDF membrane, and confirm uniform membrane background before you transfer. Stain gels with Coomassie blue after transfer to see if the gel retained any proteins. Try 4-8 hours at room temperature, or overnight at 4 C. For PVDF membranes, add SDS to secondary antibody incubation (not primary antibody incubation or wash step) at 0.01  0.02%. Avoid BSA for blocking. Try loading a dilution series that ends with the original amount of antigen that didnt produce enough signal. Air-dry membranes completely for 1 hour (or 10 minutes at 37 C) after transfer, to make binding irreversible. For PVDF membranes, re-activate membranes with methanol and rinse with water before blocking. For more details, get the Protein Electrotransfer Methods technical note. This is especially important if youre planning to strip and reprobe the blot. Validate your transfer method to ensure your target antigen transfers under the preset conditions. If you must block multiple membranes in the same dish, use enough blocking buffer for all membranes to move freely and fully contact the blocker.                                     biosales@licor.com Gently agitate during every antibody incubation. To get good membrane retention of these smaller proteins, use higher methanol concentrations (30  40%) and lower voltage transfer. Terms of Use | Privacy Policy | Cookie Notice. Avoid reusing antibody. Minimize this by using a lower scan intensity setting in the channel that had strong signal. If you have an Odyssey CLx Imaging System, try the AutoScan mode. Dilute between 1:10,000  1:40,000 for optimal performance. A dilution series of each will also help you save on sample and antibody. After blocking, keep membrane completely wet at all times during the blotting process. Avoid touching membranes with gloved or ungloved hands, as fingerprints will fluoresce on the Odyssey Imaging System. Avoid blocking membranes for more than 1 hour. Before you use them, clean dishes, bags, or trays for incubations with methanol. Clean transfer pads and transfer boxes by soaking them in 100% methanol for 10 minutes. Do not add secondary antibodies at concentrations higher than 1:10,000 dilutions, as high background will result. Increase amount of primary or secondary antibody, optimizing for best performance. Clean trays with an alcohol-based cleaner before you image. Sign up for emails and access exclusive application notes, protocols, and assay tipsall built on scientific expertise. Small proteins may pass through the membrane during transfer (blow-through). Always handle membranes with clean forceps, free of any contaminants or antibody solutions. To avoid cross-reactivity: Check your fluorescent dye. Do not add detergent to the blocking step. Some antibodies require an even lower concentration. Loading too much sample can result in your target antigen being masked by other proteins or antibody hindrance. 4647 Superior Street If you encounter high background or unexpected bands, try a different blocker. Increase amount of antibody or try a different supplier. Always clean your imaging system before you image. Use pencil to mark membranes. Transfer pads in wet tank systems and transfer boxes accumulate residue after frequent use that can cause speckles on Western blot membranes. Block membranes at room temperature. Transfer of large proteins (>140 kDa) often requires lower methanol concentrations (10%) and possibly the addition of SDS to 0.05%. Dirty forceps deposit dye on the membrane that you cant wash away. Clean scanning surface and mat carefully before each use. Primary and secondary antibodies can lose reactivity from improper or extended storage. For the Odyssey Fc Imaging System, avoid using imaging trays that have been used for Coomassie stained gel imaging. Clean dishes, boxes, or trays with methanol before using them for incubation.                                     P.O. Wash 4 times, for 5 minutes each wash. Use only highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibodies, like the. Fluorophores like Alexa Fluor 750 may appear in both channels (700 nm and 800 nm) and are not recommended for use with Odyssey Imaging Systems. Loading too little sample can result in not enough antigen present. In two-color Western blots, antibody cross-reactivity is always a possibility. Note: presence of up to 0.05% SDS does improve transfer efficiency of some proteins. Instead, try an Intercept Blocking Buffer. LI-COR prescreens Immobilon-FL PVDF membrane kits for quality control. If using nitrocellulose, wet membrane in PBS or TBS for 5 minutes, or until uniform in color, before blocking. Wet membrane in PBS or TBS for 5 minutes or until uniform in color. If background persists, increase the number of washes and buffer volume. Examine the products shelf life, and consider replacing with fresh antibody stocks. Different primary antibodies will react differently in different blocking buffers.  See what each channel looks like individually before you detect the two secondary antibodies together on the same blot, to help you know what bands to expect and where to expect them. Drying the membrane allows proteins to bind tightly to the membrane, preventing potential signal loss. For nitrocellulose membranes, do not add SDS to any steps. Sheep and goat antibodies will also cross-react.                                     Technical Support,  Excess Tween 20 (0.5  1%) may decrease signal.                                     Sales Support Dilute antibodies in the same blocking solution that you used to block the blot.
