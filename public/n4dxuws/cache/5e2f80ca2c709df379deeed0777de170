The bounce curl creme gel leaves my hair not great but ok, I would like more hold and shine though. Hair that takes a long time to dry is a sign of high porosity hair. How long? Hope that helps x. Hi Gabriella, I am new to the curly girl method but I have used the Aphogee 2 step treatment a few times. Hi Shilpi, from what youre describing, your hair is over moisturised and lacking in protein. Hello!! Thank you for all of your excellent work! Hopefully your curls will bounce back in a couple of washes. This was extremely helpful! My hair was getting both more curly and more shiny the first few months (its always felt and looked pretty coarse and dull), but recently it started getting less curly, more weighed down, puffy and more frizzy, and I couldnt understand why. For instance, on a bad day, I have soft, limp, loose waves that wont hold a curl which sounds like moisture overload but when I do a strand test my hair does not stretch very much before it breaks which sounds like protein overload. May be used daily to refresh style and alleviate dryness. I then put together a routine and recommend products to suit your hairs needs, your budget and any other requirements you have. Avoid getting into eyes. But balancing it makes SO much more sense. Selected quantity exceeds what is currently available. It all depends on your hair. I think Im using good products (moptop gentle shampoo, Asiam cowash once a week in between shampoo days, gvp conditioner, and I have stylers from jessicurl, the Bouncecurl clump cream, devacurl cream, Ouidad Climate control gel, and herbal essence mousse). We focus so much on moisture and hydration, because were told thats what curly hair needs, what it lacks. If your hair is over moisturised, washing your hair every day, or too often, can make the situation worse. Ill definitely take your recommendations I may try the LMG approach too. You and your curls are beautiful too! Hi Gabriella- serious help needed here please! I recommend booking in for a 1:1 Curl Clinic. Hi Karoline, it sounds to me like protein overload. That Mielle deep conditioner doesnt seem to be a protein focused one, which is what you need. If its better, then continue and you can leave on for longer if you feel like your hair needs it. Cleanse with one of the As I Am cleansers and apply As I Am Leave-In Conditioner. I love the Leave In Conditioner, packed with protein goodness to leave your curls healthy and strong. is formulated with lots of vegetable glycerin, plus many other natural moisturizers and plant-based conditioners. Im hoping my curls will get a little closer to your definition when I get the hang of this caring-for-my-curly-hair thing. In extreme cases, such as heat damage or chemical damage, weak hair (lack of protein) will cause breakage and a loss of curl pattern. Like with most things, once you really tune into something, you realise more and more and how delicate the balance is, and how easily its thrown off balance. I cant figure out what to do and there is no hair style that looks good because its only broken at the crown. I recently found your blog, I am very new to curly girl method. Newsletter to receive my latest posts, exclusive content, new products, Hi Olga, I just use Step 1, and then follow up using one of my CG friendly, silicone-free hair masks afterwards to deep condition. I live in South Africa so unfortunately we dont have access to the range of products that you do. But as soon as I rinse it out, I immediately have a tonne of frizz between my curl clumps. I did your modified rice water treatment and had my best wash day yet! My hair will stretch, a lot, before it snaps. x. I recommend booking in for a 1:1 Curl Clinic, theyrea 30 min consultation via video where we go through all the products youre using and the issues youre experiencing. Subscribe to get our quarterly newsletter with special offers, tips, and giveaways. Those symptoms all effect mainly the middle part of my hair. As it dries into a hard, solid cast; touching, agitating, or brushing the hair will cause it to break and snap. Whenever i spray water on hairs while refresh, they end up being lot more frizzy and less defined. I think I have 2c-3a curls that at best will turn into ringlets but are usually, stretch out and stringy looking. I think my hair needs moisture. Should I try flaxseed gel or protein free products? If your hair is very brittle, and breaking a lot then that would mean youve got too much protein and not enough moisture in the hair  which is what it sounds like you have. The wet frizz and pulled out curls were the description I needed to sort this out. Could you help diagnose me? Thanks as always! My hair is naturally very dry, with a lot of split ends, but also has a lot of volume. When your hair is not in balance, like in food, here are some tell-tale signs your hair gives you. I am about 3 weeks into my journey and have noticed that my face framing pieces of hair look and feel very coarse and dry. I also believe my hair is low porosity with some areas being more medium porosity. Symptoms include brittle hair that snaps and breaks very easily. I realize that I have over moisturized hair  will use the RWR and try this. For reference currently I clarify/chelate once a fortnight (I am trying to lengthen this but at the moment it needs to be this frequently), cowash with as i am coconut or with bounce curl low poo twice a week, and condition with a stout based conditioner, rice pudding leave in and then orange marmalade. Now that Ive checked all my products, they seem to all be moisturizing, with little to no protein! Just the Step 1. but im glad i can relate because now i know what to do with this situation. Balanced, nothing extreme. To resolve the detangling issue, I recommend using a shampoo that has good slip and some moisturising properties so you can detangle if needs be, I find MopTop or Bounce Curl the best for that. I'll try clarifying again and then try it once more (: Thanks! This is a very helpful post! When my hair dries it becomes really dry and brittle. Thank you so much for this blog. We're sorry, this product cannot ship to the following locations: Skip leave in conditioner. We do have hard water here. The proteins are the building blocks of your hair; they give strands strength and structure. Hi, okay so its a little tricker if you dont have the curl to be able to see if it drops. Is it possible that I may be over moisturized? I dont think youre in severe hygral fatigue, or any kind of hygral fatigue because you said your hair is dry and breaking. Hope that helps. Ive also played around with detangling methods (fingers vs wide-toothed comb), and I have a feeling that I need to detangle just a bit more to prevent some tangles and related frizz. Nobody notices is but me, but its my hair so I can tell the change. This is my go to page when i need the reminder of the protein/moisture balance. But the frizzy hair doesnt feel dry; it feels soft, smooth and moisturised. When I had hygral fatigue, my hair felt like it was going to disintegrate away between my fingers when I touched it. Click here for more info and to buy them from my Etsy store. Again thank you for taking the time out to explain everything and for helping x. Hi. Designed to help get your waves and curls back and achieve your healthy hair goals. Ive been so frustrated with my hair that Ive been ready to completely give up on my curly girl routine! Using products, often cheap and with poor quality ingredients, that are full of heavy oils, butters and moisturising ingredients/agents. Ive always had long, thick beach wave kind of hair but recently its become so much thicker and wavier but with more tangles and frizz so its becoming very unmanageable. See this post for more details: https://curlmaven.ie/my-rice-water-rinse-routine-results/ Hope that helps xoxo. Then I stumbled across a youtube-video and eventually ended up here, and now Im pretty certain its because of moisture overload and no clarifying. You need to change up your routine, and introduce some products that contain protein to get the balance right. It began to help. Another quick question: do you suggest using a deep conditioner with protein after using Bumble & Bumble if hair needs protein? My hair was doing pretty great on the DevaCurl cleansing products, I was dappling into trying some of the other styling products because I wasnt totally in love with my styling results and then all the negative PR about women losing their hair etc. First of all, not everyones curl pattern starts from the root. Sorry for the long comment. For example, my hair responds well to protein in cleansers, conditioners, deep condtioners and treatments, such as the ones already mentioned. I thought it was in need of more moisture but as it dried my curls didnt clump like usual, they were stretched and really soft and some strands were fully straight Now that Ive read your post, I know that my hair is suffering form moisture overload and Ill hopefully fix it using your advices So Thank you, that was really helpful! iHerb.com I recommend booking in for a 1:1 Curl Clinic, which is a 30 minute video consultation where we go through your hair, your products, your routine, what issues your struggling with and I put together a recommended product and technique routine for you, based on your hairs needs. Do you have any suggestions please? Sending you so much love. Protein forstrength and moisture forsoftness. One rice water treatment isnt going to fix weeks or months of over moisturising your hair. The easiest, cheapest and most natural way is to eat more protein and wait for your hair to catch up to your new healthier lifestyle. Im new to the curly girl community and was wondering: is it possible to experience both moisture overload and protein overload at the same time (not just in different sections of hair, but throughout)? Your blog is amazing, Im so glad I stumbled across it, and your hair is absolutely gorgeous! My curl is 2b-2c, 2c at the bottom half of my hair, top is 2b and goes flat easily. I currently need a shampoo for regular use that cleans my scalp but doesnt wreck everything else. It seems like they (especially curl junky) is too moisturizing to recover my hair with amount of protein. Im having better luck, but the wet frizz is really wearing on me. Right now I dont have any protein in my routine. Thank you so much for this enlightening post, however, Im struggling with diagnosing what is wrong with my hair. Ive tried so many products. Thank you so much, Im so glad you found this post helpful xoxo, Hi Gabriella! Thank you Gabriella! I mainly use Cantu and OGX products (I live in Switzerland and the range of curl-friendly products is pretty much limited to those two brands.
