Heres another thread about this, for more info.  gear reduction transmission such as a jack-shaft is used with them to  If you keep your tyre pressures topped up to the correct pressures you will drastically reduce your risk of getting flats. For e scooters and e go karts, most of them adhere to the 1 gearing theory. Kits made for electric scooters, go karts, and other similar vehicles with 6"-12" wheels. Most of the time it is farther away from the bike and lines up with the higher gears. If youre going to overload a CVT your best bet is to keep it spinning fast which means gearing it lower which means lower top speeds which means crappy commuter. I don't want to go any faster than that on this bike anyway! The best way to test to see if your gear is too high is to shift into the lowest gear and then start moving while pedaling on level ground. https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/products/104-bcd-stainless-steel-chainrings. A bike geared with normal pedal cadence from a standstill on level ground in the lowest gear is going to make a poor trail bike because in order to get moving from a standstill on a steep incline you will need much lower gears. also be increased above the top speed calculation by riding down hill, or riding  This article focuses on the BBS02 & BBSHD drive units, but the same logic is applicable to most other mid drive setups on the market. At first it was a 42t but I've found I can increase my cadence a bit from where I was before and now a 39t is very sweet for me. Gear motors are  You are of course free to ride the bike as fast as you can above the cut off speed provided you have the legs for it. For me I like a blend of off road and on road or a good combo of torque and top speed. You can easily swap the rear cog on 3 speed IGH all the way up to a 24T cog. Two things: 					 Rock crawler and high speed road runner all in one! You can grind down your bottom bracket on the drive side to move the drive unit over, or you can carve away a notch on the mid drive case where it hits the chainstay. Its nice to be able to pedal along at 35mph. We hope some of these tips help! It has 100mm BB and runs 264.6 tires. This I have no idea. Seems like you need to clarify exactly what question you wanted answered, because the question people have answered seems to be different than the one you may want answered. I've upgraded to a 60 tooth ring up front (while the existing 7 speed 11/28 cog remains in the rear), and can now actually pedal at over 20 mph with a cadence of about 60 (my comfort zone). I'm glad to have variable gearing on my BBS02, even though I mostly run it in the lowest two gears. With the increasing popularity of the electric bike as an urban mode of transport though manufacturers have invested significant R&D into developing gearing systems that can handle stronger motors. Wire In fact, you probably don't even think about it because you just know what gears to put on your bike for the type of riding that you do. Make sure it is for the3-speedd IGH as the 8 speed SA uses a cog with a much larger hole (insert inappropriate comment here). You will change gears many, many times every time you ride so cables stretch,the chain will wear and knocks and bumps can move it out of alignment. No matter what kind of chainring you opt for with whatever mid drive you have I only recommend going with Narrow\Wide setups. This combination creates the lowest maintenance possible, on some of the best performing ebikes available. I actually used a 3x7 but honestly I hardly ever pedal. 26 MTB. I live on a steep mountain (30 % is easy) and nothing i cant climb up.literaly. Speed Controllers 		check out the. Enjoy The Ride. LOL youre crazy dude! I have an Origin 8 fat tire with eRad 350 watt mid drive. Although this system is not perfect it works pretty well and its easy for my puny brain to understand. Should the 36t/22t combo work for these hills without breaking another hub? BTW Im putting probably a 44t on my electric ute. An ebike (or electric bike) is a bicycle that has an electric drive system which provides extra pedal power to assist you when you are riding. Battery Harnesses The Tangent Ascent ships with a much smaller chainring which should work fine for singletrack trail riding. Keep in mind that the lower double and triple ranges are for systems with a front derailleur which your mid drive probably wont have. Hey everyone. Should I just feel out my E bike the same way and then just leave it in that gear? Im finishing up my first Mountain 26 inch E bike build. The internal hub is a closed system so your gears are protected from moisture and dirt at all times. Leave a comment below so that others can learn from your successes and failures. A perfect candidate for grinding away the case. W/. Do these hub motors have a internal gear ratio? I really hope that was helpful.

Read on and learn more about the tech that makes them tick. 					 Throttles This seems to be completely unknown to the e-bike community. Dealer Discounts |  The newest 1X groupings with the massive granny gears have ranges without a front derailleur that we used to only dream of, the problem is that the cassettes are not that durable. The Luna Eclipse42T is arguably the most attractive of all the aftermarket options. A large 42T+ aluminum granny will not survive long with a high power mid drive. Planetary gears? Whichtype of gearing system is best for you and your electric bike depends on the type of rider you are and the type of riding you like to, or want to, do.

And then here on the rear of the freewheel, we have seven gears ranging between 18 teeth and 28 teeth. Brake Cables a mountain bike like I use, the largest chain ring that can be used is around 50T and since the largest gears on the free wheel are not used, a longer chain is not needed. TheEnviolo internal gearing systems was developed specifically to provide an internal gear solution to handle high torque electric bike motors such as theBosch Performance and Performance CX systems. This calculator determines the top speed of the vehicle with no  Both for exercise, and for maximizing my range. Karl,  Thanks for this info and frankly all of your articles that have helped me understand what bike and technology for my own build. Relays Ive got an 11/42 SRAM at the back on 26 wheels, and the Bafang comes with a 44 chainwheel. I have 2 bikes (Focus Jam2 with Shimano E8000 motor and a Specialized Turbo Levo with Brose 2.1 motor). The N380 hates the jerk when it first gets a power kick. For both types there are lower and higher cost options. Youll probably end up with a 16T or smaller. Help it out on starts and steep hills. Sometimes I'd change out my front chainring, depending on if there was a steeper race or flatter one. The Rohloff E-14 with its SpeedHub is the best gearing system on offer. When powered, crank work is useless because it couldnt add any significant power or speed. All right, so let's talk about Gear Ratios on E-Bike. When I had to buy a replacement Bosch CX motor [outwith warranty], I had to supply the make of bike it was being fitted to, the wheel size, the front sprocket size along with the min and max derailuer sprocket size. If you buy a derailleur that is specifically designed for cassettes that have more than 36T then this will not be a problem. Unfortudently for most trail bikes while this is an optimal configuration, it is just not achievable. Lighting Dont waste your time, this chainring sucks more than my 20-year-old shop vac. Turn Signals Too large a chain ring can ruin the anti-squat designed into the frame. There is a steel version of that cassette which I have yet to test, but one of the problems I found with a normal derailleur is problems with clearance on the biggest granny. For 29, 26 fatbike tires or 700c wheels and a normal cassette I would go with 42T (higher torque)  48T (higher top speed). Bafang sells a 46T steel ringstock with the BBSHD that you can buy for $25 here (why you would want to is absolutely beyond me, masochisticmuch?). This generally will be in the 4.5-5.5 ratio range. Im up in Fairwood in Renton, great write up mate, excellent info, you have saved me weeks if not monthsthank you, New 40T Chainring Precialps for Bafang BBS01 or BBS02. So the first thing is, what is the gear ratio? (LogOut/ Their components are top notch. 					 Let's comeback to the three questions to help you narrow down what you want / need: If you haven't made up your mind already on what you think suits you best then we will be happy to help. Where are you in Seattle?? If I were somehow able to modify the front derailleur to work 20mm outboard from stock (unlikely), do you think I could shift from one N/W to another? This offers the advantage of even less maintenance and grease and it is lightweight and especially quiet. Circuit Breakers I mean if it does not make a difference I can always use my chain breaker and remove the chain if its not beneficial.

And this is usually presented as a percentage. Bulbs Granted it is a 60V 6KW beast. Drive Belts Adjust your programming START CURRENT under PAS and throttle to 1. Ideal gear ratio for PAS 3 speed? I use only 2 gears out of seven on cassette . All my other builds from my 24 Volt rc lawn mower and 48 Volt e scooter and 48 Volt E go Kart all use a stepper or direct 48 Volt 1500 Watt motor.

On my bench it works just fine without any of that stuff connected. 								by Chalo  Apr 27 2018 8:46pm, Post If the chainring comes back too far and hits your chainstay then you can always space it back out using a chainring spacer. 					 Thanks for your info, BTWits been really helpful. 38 mph top and on the low end Ill break traction and/or flip it over before running out of torque. The Sur Ron seems to me the exception when talking about 1 gear to multiple gears for E bikes. The hub unit does not require servicing as regularly as derailleur gears but it is still important to service it. 								by dogman dan  Apr 21 2018 12:46pm, Post What are your recommended sources for  BIG chainrings? Paved road inclines rarely are more than about 10 degrees but if you are trail riding on normal singletrack it is not uncommon to have to ride up 20+ degree inclines. City of Calgary changed by-law recently and ebikes are finally allowed on pathways , so great news for Calgary riders. You might want to go with a Rohloff if you want lots of gears and for it to stand up to abuse. If you are running a 36T front ring and a18T cog (36T  18T = 18 tooth difference) and want to bump up to a 42T front ring then you will need to bump up to a 24T cog to have approximately the same drive ratio (42T  18 (difference from original drivetrain) =24T). For CVTs you can also use the 42T chainring and experiment with cogs sizes, for a 26 tire youll probably settle on the 22T like I did. 								by motomech  Apr 27 2018 9:39pm, Post There are several other sellers in Europe for the Bafang BBS02 custom chainrings but I have not tested any of them so anything I said about them would be hearsay (people generally seem to like them). I care about the price, but got one anyway. It allows the usual 3x front sprockets on mountain bikes. It's Peter Kaltreider at Sixthreezero bicycles. 					 Mirrors The complication with electric bikes and internal hub gears is that the extra torque generated by the motor can make it difficult to shift while pedalling, particularly if going uphill. Look up Sun Race CSMS2. You could put it in a different way and say, the easy gear is twice as easy as the fast gear. Do an ebay search for Sturmey Archer 24T (or whatever size cog you need) and you should get several options. General Discussion about electric bicycles. Fuses Im using a Voilamart 48V 1500W rear hub motor. Seats Looks like the Rize gearing is fairly typical. Picking the right chainring size for your ride is likely to be one of the biggest decisions you will make for your home-built ebike.
