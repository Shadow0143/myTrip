Ingredients:DIMETHICONE, TRIMETHYLSILOXYSILICATE, POLYETHYLENE, ACRYLATES/STEARYL ACRYLATE/DIMETHICONE METHACRYLATE COPOLYMER, SYNTHETIC FLUORPHLOGOPITE, NYLON-12, PARAFFIN, POLYISOBUTENE, CERA MICROCRISTALLINA / MICROCRYSTALLINE WAX, ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE, CALCIUM SODIUM BOROSILICATE, SILICA, ALUMINA, PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRA-DI-T-BUTYL HYDROXYHYDROCINNAMATE, TIN OXIDE, BHT. Use tab to navigate through the menu items. Blends nice. J'aime beaucoup l'ide d'associer mon liner  la couleur de mon haut. A ce sujet la marque prconise d'utiliser le petit trou du taille-crayon. Nul besoin d'appuyer, le crayon glisse sur la peau.
