I still havent gotten the hang of taking accurate jean selfies (strange angles dont always capture how good/bad they look), but these are the jeans that make me feel like the best possible version of myself. Even though the smudge came out easily, I dont want to worry about it. Its the LAST FEW DAYS of the Nordstrom Sale! I was delighted to find out one opened up just 10 minutes away from Bensons and my moms houses, so I took advantage of that while we visited them. The pink colored shorts are from JCrew and the mint and khaki colored shorts are from Factory.  Color offering - Most neutral colors are offered on both sites, but the color availability is not entirely the same. Diana Stretch Skinny Jeans(size 4 & 6)  I reviewed these in grey sz 6 last time. I have a pair in mint and am eyeing up grabbing a neutral pair. This means that when you shop through my links, I may earn a small commission, which helps make this blog possible. The only issue I've had with Factory is that the hems come out, consistently, after the first wash. I was surprised but glad to hear how much some of you enjoy these review posts! These are the Spokane Wash. Since many of my rayon garments have shrunk in the past (annoying!) Happy to report there was no excessive wrinkling! With ample JCrew coupons floating around, I've rarely paid full price for an item there. Thanks for this! It's an easy enough fix but a real pain in the ass. I used to live in NorCal where the summers could get beyond 100F and I can see where thinner shorts would come in handy. Hefty material with lots of stretch, and not a bad price for good jeans while on sale. Nickel & Suede Earrings (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); 2011-2020 PUTTING ME TOGETHER, LLC. when compared to the same size of the JCrew shorts. Maybe? Join the Waitlist for Simply Put Together. Sizing down to sz 4 improved the crotch area, but there was still excess material in the leg.

Im trying to order this in ivory also, which would mean I wouldnt need the white one above anyway. H&M. This ones not heavy or sturdy like some gingham button ups. Also remember, Nordstrom has FREE shipping BOTH WAYS with no minimum purchase. LOFT I was certain sizing up to L would look strange around my shoulders, but nope. Wellp, like I said in the last post, here are some Old Navy and J.Crew keepers from vacation, plus an update on my last Nordstrom order, and a few more things I picked up. Both S and M looked awkward on me, fitting my shoulders but being a little short and not having quite enough fabric to drape well. Theres a 4 Chino Short HERE in fun colors like coral and turquoise, though Im not sure if the fit is the same. It drapes SO WELL that its okay thats long because the nice drape means it half-tucks nicely. This is my second wear of the Factory shorts but I'll definitely pay attention to that. I think I had a wrinkle problem last time because I ironed it and threw it on my bed without letting it cool completely. For the grey pair I had problems with excess material all over, particularly the leg and crotch. That was a lot of stuff, but they are all pieces Im extremely happy with. Minor details - The JCrew shorts have a button on one of the back pockets, they have wider belt loops and a longer hem length. The pic above was taken after several hours of wear around the house. (I personally find shopping within a budgetfreeing, not confining! So, even though I went shopping crazy the last month, I dont feel guilty about it. If you wanted to place an order, youd better get on it! Thanks for the tip! Outside of white (and I don't wear white shorts bc they're too hard to keep clean), I don't see enough of a difference in the Factory vs regular shorts to warrant the extra $20. I wear a 00. Maroon is in and out of being sold out, so you might get lucky and catch it when people return it. Might be a deal breaker for some of you! ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Comes in 8 colors. There is lots of room in the legs. The Dark Wash is also on its way to my house because comfortable denim shorts are hard to come by for me. I tested this by wetting it in the sink, keeping the tag dry. And this ones cheaper. Its soft and comfy, and not super tight so you can layer long sleeves under it. First up are a couple pieces from J.Crew Factory. Theyre also lightweight, which Ive appreciated every time Ive worn them this summer. That's not to say the Factory shorts are terrible, but I prefer the feel of the more luxe fabric and knowing that they will probably last longer. Nordstrom  BP. Its stretchy, a more medium weight jersey material, and drapes really well. Overall, its a great pair of jeans. For whatever reason, I have doubts that Ill actually wear the purple one that often, though it is possibly one of my favorite colors to wear and a color I have searched years for in tops (which is why I seldom wear that color). I find that this length is great for work since it's long enough to be appropriate but short enough to still allow breathing room. And thank you, Nordstrom Sale, for lowering the price to $119 for my foray into the world of designer jeans. I believe I got the JCrew shorts for about $20 dollars.

Zappos The fabric - This is the largest difference between the shorts and likely the reason for the price difference. I acquired the pink shorts last year and the mint and khaki shorts just couple weeks ago. I was concerned that the material would absorb stains easily, as I saw a small smudge on it already. Comes in light grey, olive, ivory, and black. What I love from Factory are the Boardwalk Shorts-- the elastic waist is so nice for summer, and the color range (and price point!) Paige Skinny Jeans(size 29)  THESE JEANS ARE THE BOMB. Apparently on this dress it doesnt matter. Swing Dress(size L)  I talked about this earlierHERE, but to reiterateheart eyes all around. Whew! The fabric for the JCrew shorts is heavier and sturdier, giving the shorts more structure. J.Crew Factory Also, the J.Crew Factory and Old Navy ones items were all 50-60% off retail in store! ONs comes in light wash and a medium wash. UPDATE:Mixed Media V-Neck Tunic(size Medium Petite)  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WRINKLES?

Returns are realllyyyyyy easy because you dont have to go in-store! UPDATE:Washed Chambray Shirt(size L)  In my last review (HERE) I mentioned concern about wrinkling given that its rayon, not chambray.

It is sooooo white and white + stain absorbent isnt great for baby rearing. Sweetheart Denim Shorts5(size 6)  I feel like I struck gold by finding another pair of comfortable shorts, especially denim. This time I let it cool nice and flat, then wore it. Just not for me because. 100% cotton. Old Navy J.Crew Factory Hopefully youre finding pieces you absolutely love as well! The white one was even harder to let go of, because I knew I could remix the crap out of it. Remember, if you are looking for a slightly more structured chambray top try Old Navys version HERE. I don't have a dress code for work. Maroon Cardigan(size S)  Another long sought after find from my ongoing wish list! Gosh, I really love how this hangs! And since cleaning out my closet withmy new rulesI am trying hard to keep pieces that I just want to wear all the stinking time. This one is hard to let go of. Wrinkles are from packaging; I didnt iron beforehand. Again, there is room in the legs, though not as much as the J.Crew Factory Chino Shorts. I lucked out and got them on crazy sale online! If you dont shop within a budget, I highly recommend it!) I've attached some images here for reference: http://imgur.com/a/pmldk.

The regular J crew ones are sometimes heavier than what I want to wear for summer. Nordstrom  Lush Navy Gingham(size S)  Lightweight and perfect fit! It would be better for summer or spring in most areas, but San Diego is seldom cold, so this will be great for fall/winter here too. But heres one last hurrah before I package it up for goodI LOVE HOW IT LOOKS! That's an interesting point I hadn't considered!

Anyway, Im happy to report if it shrank at all I didnt notice, or it wasnt significant. Its also a VERY great top and it did not shrink either. The pattern appears to be the same and the number of pockets is the same - I'd say that they both hit me at about the same place (I'm very petite so they might appear shorter on you). The thinner fabrics are great for DC's humid summers too. I live in Seattle now so this wasn't really a concern for me anymore. I cant tell you how long Ive been looking for a navy gingham top, and I have been eyeing ones at J.Crew Factory for many seasons. That said, Ive decided to return both of them, even though I actually LOVE both. Amazon Womens Fashion Important note, the sleeves have a wide knit, so its not that warm for a sweater cardigan. I think this is due to the fabric weight disparity that you mentioned! I have experienced much flimsier fabric and more wrinkles from the Factory shorts, as well. Old Navys Sweetheart cut tends to be for those of us with curvier hips. I'm another vote for preferring the Factory shorts.
