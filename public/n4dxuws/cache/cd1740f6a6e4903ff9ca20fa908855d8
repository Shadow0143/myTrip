The following formula provides a result of .45 pounds per foot. A. + 218.69 + 2% =, 6 per foot x 1.50% = .4575 lbs./ft. - (6'-0 x 30 lbs./ft.) x 0.707107= 383.37 lbs.   to 4 = 13.6 ft. x .4575 lbs./ft. hooks and 6 lb. This calculation yields the circumference of the rollers. 				Copyright  2017 McGinty Conveyors Inc. All rights reserved. Divide this distance by carrier spacing to determine number of loaded carriers. Product carrier weight, product weight, coefficient of friction, track curves, inclines, declines, temperature and lubrication are some of the principle items affecting chain pull. STEP #2: DETERMINE QUANTITY OF LOADED AND UNLOADED CARRIERS. The procedure of accumulating at each curve is followed back to "0". 542.17 Please copy and paste this embed script to where you want to embed.

Whether you need help solving quadratic equations, inspiration for the upcoming science fair or the latest update on a major storm, Sciencing is here to help. 0 Jesse Randall studied mathematics and physics and works as an embedded electronics engineer, developing microcontroller firmware and digital interfaces. In Figure #2, a conveyor is shown identical to Figure #1 except for the addition of an incline and decline. + 0 lbs. Please help us to share our service with your friends. Zojo Site by ZojoMedia.com. Count how many full rotations are made by the roller in one minute. However, an endless conveyor chain must at least have horizontal curves, and each of these generate additional forces which must be taken into account as will be seen in Figure #1. resultant plus 2% for the 90 curve.  2022 Leaf Group Ltd. / Leaf Group Media, All Rights Reserved. You consent to our cookies if you continue to use this website. In systems having multiple rises and falls, this may be treated somewhat differently, depending on loading patterns. To calculate this force, determine the difference in elevation of all the vertical curves traveling upward in the system. A. D. Multiply weight of product only by number of loaded carriers only as determined in Step #2. and the 2% friction for the 90 curve is added. Measure the revolutions per minute of the rollers. It will be seen that straight conveyor has a friction factor of 1.50%.   to 1 = 6.7 ft. x .4575 lbs./ft. The lift load for the elevation changes of the conveyor is equal to the total lift height (in feet) multiplied by the individual product weight (in pounds), then divided by the load spacing centers in feet. + 2% =, 5 + 6.97 lbs.   to 2 = 6.7 ft. x .4575 lbs./ft. A large number of vertical and horizontal curves will create slightly higher friction. In this example, the conveyor runs at approximately 0.05947 MPH. as the additional force induced by the rise. Every time the roller spins one revolution, the conveyor is moved a linear distance equivalent to the circumference of the roller. Pi is a dimensionless factor, meaning it does not matter whether inches, centimeters or any other units of measurement are used. In Figure #1 a simple system about 115'-0" long is shown with four horizontal curves. Add lift load obtained in Step #4 to (A) to obtain total chain pull. To arrive at this figure, it is necessary to add the lift load and the friction factors, expressed as a small percentage of the live load, which act as resistance to the progress of the conveyor. =, 1   to 1 = 11 ft. x .4575 lbs./ft. The speed at which the conveyor belt moves depends on the size of the rollers and their revolutions per minute. + (6'-0 x 30 lbs./ft.) Objects and materials placed on top of the conveyor belt will be moved from one edge to the other as the rollers spin. Multiply weight of pendants by required number of total pendants in system. Therefore, if a conveyor did not have any vertical or horizontal curves, inclines or declines, the weight of the total live or moving load could be multiplied by 1.50% to determine the weight in pounds to move the conveyor. + 2%, 3 Many factors, which vary greatly from system to system, influence the end result. Copyright  2022 Sparks Belting All Rights Reserved  | Privacy Policy | Business Terms, inclined belt conveyor design calculation. When adverse environment conditions exist or the conveyor is abnormally long or complex and exceeds the chain pull capacity of one drive, a progressive chain pull computation is necessary where the friction losses are progressively calculated and accumulated through the path along the conveyor.   to 6 = 8.1 ft. x .4575 lbs./ft. + 3.13 lbs. + 2% =, 3 Get product updates and company news delivered directly to your inbox.  In the following computation, it will be seen that the footage from the down stream end of the drive to the far tangent of the next curve (0 to 1) is multiplied by .45 lbs. For example, a roller with a diameter of 2 inches, has a circumference of 2 x 3.14159 or 6.28 inches.   lbs. Multiply the RPM by the circumference of the roller. When making measurements, keep fingers away from the rollers. + 36.31 lbs. loads on 1'-0" centers would be 10 lbs. Calculate the distance traveled for one hour. = 30.5 lbs. Distance traveled, or displacement, per a change in time is the definition of velocity, or speed and direction. The above friction factors were obtained from accurate laboratory tests with lubricated chain and have been verified by dynamometer tests of complete systems. The first item to be determined is the pounds in chain pull per foot of straight conveyor. Next, the footage from (1) to (2) is multiplied by .45 lbs., added to the 3.08 lb. Chain Pull, SHORT CUT METHOD OF CHAIN PULL CALCULATION (Approximation Only). They can pull your fingers in quickly and smash them between the conveyor belt, causing severe injury. CHAIN PULL CALCULATION FOR A LEVEL SYSTEM. For instance, a 100'-0" conveyor with 1.5 lb. =, CHAIN PULL CALCULATION FOR A MULTI-LEVEL SYSTEM.   to 0 = 33.8 ft. x .4575 lbs./ft. "WE SERVICE WHAT WE SELL" Online Store Terms and Warranty.   to 5 = 37.9 ft. x .4575 lbs./ft. Multiply one more time by 60 to arrive at the total inches traveled per hour which equals 3,768. Chain pull is the effort necessary to maintain the normal operating speed of a conveyor under a related load. + 2% =, 4 When the loads are spaced under 2'-0" on centers, the formula of the total pounds per foot multiplied by the rise in feet can be used to determine the additional force in pounds for the inclined section. chain pull. If calculated chain pull using this short cut method is in excess of 550 pounds per drive, you must use the long point-to-point accumulation method of calculation. This calculation provides the linear distance traversed by a point on the conveyor belt in one minute. Multiply the diameter of the roller by pi, 3.14159. @ 1.50% = 15 lbs. When the head and tail pulley are the same size:L=(D+d)/2 x 3.1416+2CWhen one pulley is larger than the other pulley:L=(D+d)/2 x 3.1416+2C+(D-d)2/4c, At one time when the load is known per square foot:P= G1 x C(in feet)x W (in feet)At one time when load is known by pounds per hour:P=G2/(S x 60) x C(in feet), Level Conveyors:HP=(F x S x (P+M))/33,000Inclined Conveyors:HP=((P x B)+(P+M)x F x S)/33,000, Pull needed to move belt and load horizontally:E= F x (P+M), Total tension to move belt and load horizontally:E2= E+E1, Additional tension required to prevent slippage on drive pulley:E1=Ex K, Determines the working strength of the belt to handle the job on per inch of width basis:T= E2/W. Please fill this form, we will try to respond as soon as possible. We need your help to maintenance and improve this website. Understanding a basic conveyor belt calculation will ensure your conveyor design is accurate and is not putting too many demands on your system. He has been writing on technology-related subjects since 2000. B. Multiply weight of the chain (3.0 lbs.) Thank you for using our services. Due to the elevations changes, the formula for finding the pounds per foot chain pull is arranged differently because it must be assumed that at some point the incline will be loaded and the decline empty. Design Data - Step 4: Chain Pull Calculation. The net vertical rise (in feet) will be considered the total lifting height of the conveyor. + 6.97 lbs. To determine the chain pull due to friction, multiply total moving load by selected friction factor. or 180 lbs. + 31.89 lbs. + 197.06 lbs. Next, divide by 12 to arrive at 314 feet, then divide by 5,280, to convert to miles per hour, 12 inches = 1 foot and 5,280 feet = 1 mile. Multiply that figure by the number of revolutions, in this example, 10 to arrive at a total of 62.8 inches traveled per minute. B. + 2% =, 4 We are a non-profit group that run this service to share documents. per foot) x 100'-0" or 1000 lbs.   to 0 = 42.4 ft. x .4575 lbs./ft. The lift load is the amount of force required to pull the live load upward along the vertical curves in the entire system. =. Friction resistance is found in the bearings of the chain wheels, curves, and the drive unit itself. + 2% =, 2 Our goal is to make science relevant and fun for everyone. 				About Us | Products | Services | Resources | Contact Us | Site Map   to 4 = 8.1 ft. x .4575 lbs./ft. per foot (including chain @ 2.5 lbs. + 2% =, 1 by the number of feet of chain. + 3.13 lbs. Measure the diameter of the rollers around which the conveyor belt is wrapped. He writes about subjects including abiogenesis, electrochemistry and algorithm optimization. Next, divide by 12, then divide by 5,280, to convert to miles per hour (12 inches = 1 foot and 5,280 feet = 1 mile).   to 2 = 8.1 ft. x 4575 lbs./ft. To convert the speed of the conveyor belt from inches per minute to miles per hour, multiply by 60 to convert to inches per hour.   to 3 = 53.1 ft. x .4575 lbs./ft. It should be noted that these percentages are for average conveyors that travel under normal conditions. In situations where the loads are more than 2'-0" on centers, a more accurate result can be achieved by multiplying the total live load on the inclined portion by the sine of the angle of incline. C. Multiply weight of empty product hooks or carriers by total number of carriers in system. + 226.84 lbs. The live load on a conveyor is equal to the sum of weights of the chain, pendants, product hook or carrier, and the product. Establish distance from loading to unloading. This can be seen in the chain pull calculation for the conveyor in Figure #2 from point #3 to #4. E. Total of A, B, C, D = total live load on the conveyor system. To keep our site running, we need your help to cover our server cost (about $500/m), a small donation will help us a lot. Using a 2.50% friction factor for the short cut method will cover most normal conditions. + 2% =, 2 Manufacturers and grocery stores typically use conveyors to move products along a specific path. However, by knowing the value of the various factors, the total chain pull may be determined by the point to point accumulation method of calculation. It is expressed as (6-0 x 30 lbs./ft.) We also share information about your use of our site with our social media, advertising, and analytics partners who may combine it with other information that you've provided or that we have collected from your use of our services. Introduction of inclines and declines in a system further complicates chain pull calculation by adding to the forces. There are few, if any, short cuts in the process of determining the chain pull on an endless chain conveyor. Multiply total live load from (E) in Step #3 by friction factor of .025. Measure the circumference of the rollers in the conveyor , calculate revolutions per minute and then multiply these two figures together to determine conveyor belt speed.
